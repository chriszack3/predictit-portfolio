Full interview linked below.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Brian Kilmeade [00:22:13] See? Milwaukee. Mr. president, thanks so much for the quality time for our audience. And thanks so much for the insight. Do you think you’ll make your pick tomorrow, vice president?Donald Trump [00:22:23] No. Not tomorrow. I’ll make it close to the convention. I would love to do it. You know, it used to be picked during the convention, and it made the convention practically more interesting. The pic used to be during the convention. That’s what I’d like to do. But it, you know, with modern technology, if you can believe it, it’s like everything else, like voting used to be better with all paper ballots. I mean, modern technology uses a lot of things, and it makes it easier.  https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/07/10/fmr-president-trump-on-abortion-rewriting-the-rnc-platform-nato-president-biden-more/",

What you do know is over 8 years, 1000's of people have come to you promising this and that, swearing loyalty to the end. Ok and in the end what happened? Betrayed by almost EVERYONE. Trump met Doug in February of this year. To Trump, Burgum is just another stranger come knocking with something he wants. Trump would trust Marco or Scott 100 times over Doug cause at least Trump has known these guys for 8 years and seen what they do and what they don't do. Even knowing for sure your enemy will betray you is still 10x better than someone like Doug where you have no idea.",

Bulgur like Romney pushes \"climate change\" until the cows come home, and is the WORST Ukraine warmonger of the group.Bulgur is an establishment, Deep State favorite. EXACTLY the kind of vp Trump does NOT want! Trump today was saying Harris was Biden's \"insurance\" policy. Bulgur would be the opposite an \"uninsurance\" policy for Trump. The Deep State would want Trump gone to prop up their neocon greenie. But the Deep State would fear Vance even more than Trump. NO WAY is it the Bill Gates-loving Bulgur but he tops the charts here lol.",

Omaha and MN will be running left of MI, WI and PA. VA and MN is about making Dems play defense like Biden making Trump need to play defense in FL and NC.The election will come down to if Biden can take all of PA, MI and WI. If you like what the polls say, then you'll need to acknowledge the current aggregates of MI and WI on 538 and HQ the Hill which are both with or without RFK included a half percent to one percent in Trump's favorite.It really is not a comfortable lead. That is classic margin of error. Even PA is in the margin of error. I get that a lot of Trump's money is being spent on legal fees. But why focus so much resources cutting in to territory that is more blue traditionally if there are purple stays he isn't yet out of the margin of error on? Seems counterintuitive. And all the GOP has been doing since the '16 election is losing so I'm not exactly seeing the results in these strategies.",

Omaha and MN will be running left of MI, WI and PA. VA and MN is about making Dems play defense like Biden making Trump need to play defense in FL and NC.The election will come down to if Biden can take all of PA, MI and WI. If you like what the polls say, then you'll need to acknowledge the current aggregates of MI and WI on 538 and HQ the Hill which are both with or without RFK included a half percent to one percent in Trump's favorite.It really is not a comfortable lead. That is classic margin of error. Even PA is in the margin of error. I get that a lot of Trump's money is being spent on legal fees. But why focus so much resources cutting in to territory that is more blue traditionally if there are purple stays he isn't yet out of the margin of error on? Seems counterintuitive. And all the GOP has been doing since the '16 election is losing so I'm not exactly seeing the results in these strategies.",

        "content": "Greetings all DNom refugees! 👋 There's been a lot of information to sort through before deciding who to bet on, so consider the following evidence to guide your thinking:1. Trump wants a VP \"that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first—and second, somebody that helps you get elected, and there's nothing wrong with that.\" (7/8) \n\n\nView\n\n\n Hide\n\n\n\n\n2. Washington Post: \"They are ideally Black or a woman, though that’s not required. And they are most certainly not taller than Trump himself. [...] He does not necessarily want a successor as the leader of the MAGA movement; he would prefer that the Republican Party duke it out for his endorsement in four years, one adviser said. He wants a No. 2 who has won in the past. [...] But more than anything, he wants someone who can help him win.\" (4/12) https://www.washingtonpost....3. Despite wanting a VP that helps him get elected, he thinks the choice \"never really had that much of an effect on an election.\" Meaning the VP would help him in other ways than swinging votes. (1/31) https://www.wunc.org/2024-0...4. Some of the potential VPs Trump took an interest in organically (ie. they weren't in the news for anything) included Tom Cotton, Bill Hagerty, and Mike Lee. Trump said Lee was on the list because he \"loved Lee's haircut.\" (5/5) https://www.axios.com/2024/...5. When Trump looks at potential VPs on TV, he \"repeatedly asks 'Where is my Cary Grant?'\" Implying that he sees the way the VP can 'help' is by looking like a 1960s clean-cut actor on TV defending him - like Cotton, Hagerty, or Lee. (4/12) https://www.washingtonpost....6. Trump elaborates on what he means by Cary Grant: \"Do you remember Cary Grant? How good was he, right? I don't know what happened to movie stars today. We used to have Cary Grant, Clark Gable, and today -- I will not say names because we don't need enemies. I get enough enemies. Cary Grant was like Michael Jackson once told me, the most handsome man in the world, Cary Grant, and we don't have that anymore. The Cary Grant at 81 or 82, going on 100, this guy, he is 81 going on 100, Cary Grant would not look too good in a bathing suit either, and he was pretty good-looking, right?\" (3/9) https://www.c-span.org/vide...7. Trump told 2016 runner-up Chris Christie he picked Pence because \"you've got to admit, he's straight out of central casting.\" https://www.afr.com/world/n...8. NY Post: Trump wants a VP with \"good hair\" (6/15) https://nypost.com/2024/06/...9. AP: Trump thinks Burgum is \"central casting\" (6/24) https://apnews.com/article/...10. WSJ: Burgum is on the list because he's \"good looking\" (5/18) https://www.wsj.com/politic...When we look back on this, all the evidence will have been pointing in the same direction.",

Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now,\" the former President said in a statement. \"In the Great State of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is J.D. Vance. We cannot play games. It is all about winning.”----------------The warning sings are there that TRump is likely to pick Vance (I wish it wasn't so, but it is ) . Even Alex Jones from Info Wars is claiming he heard it from Trump junior that Vance is the pickHard to believe that Trump would pick someone only 39 with so little experience to be VP in these troubled and unpredictable times (shrug)",

Vance HAS A TON OF VIDS ATTACKING TRUMP   HE sought to dramatically reinvent himself as all in for Trump while embracing a Republican message of economic populism when he had to battle Josh Mandel and Matt Dolan  to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman. Mandel and Dolan SPLIT the tremendous opposition to Vance- together getting over 500k to hardly 340k for Vance- BUT neither would quit so they BOTH enabled Vance to win.“I’m a Never Trump guy,” Vance said in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2016, a clip that will be used by Kamala, as well as “I never liked him.” And the Vance tweet from October 2016. “My god what an idiot,” he wrote, referring to Trump as well as the 'This man is a circus performer'.TELL ME AGAIN HOW VANCE IS IN 1ST PLACE HERE?BTW- This is no post supporting Burgum- the man is 67 and himself joked in the GOP debate that he looks 77 and his optics on camera are horrid when Trump/Biden already have the age issue dominating the media- his $$$ is all that makes him attractive to Trump but it would be SOS- never VP   Any serious money here is the Burgum campaign because it's BSYou can vote 'thumbs down' it's the truth and all the JD Vance hype is BSedit- I'm posting the link to Vance writing 'Obama & Me' which NONE of you have posted in this delusion that Vance will be VP  https://www.nytimes.com/201...",

    {
        "content": "Here is why I believe Trump should and will pick Tulsi Gabbard as VP - and that this has been planned for several years.-Tulsi Gabbard was sent on a mission by Trump and Steve Bannon in 2016 after he was elected. She went to Syria and met with Assad. The meeting with Trump was for optics to begin preparing people for her. The mission was something they wanted to see if she could do - which she completed.-She also ran for president in 2020, so she could practice on the debate stage and run a campaign. Part of the plan.-She had a mission given to her by Trump's team, which was to make Kamala Harris look terrible during the debate, which she did and completed. Another preparation for four years later.-Remember, she did not vote to impeach Trump. Remember, this has been planned years ago. It would've been too difficult for her to defend the position of impeaching Trump years later to be on his ticket. She took a lot of heat for not voting to impeach him. Remember, when that decision was made, they knew she was going to VP. It was a political decision.-She spoke at CPAC. Another step in her preparing her for VP. I mean, the woman f’ing vote spoke at CPAC! You really don't think they're planning on having her in Trumps administration at the very least?-“But she endorsed Biden!\" Exactly. So she can validate the people who have the arc where they came from supporting Biden, but realized Trump is better. That's very important. Do not assume that everybody always had to be the same as you.-She left the Democrat party two years ago and did not run for reelection. Why? Because she couldn't go from Democrat congresswoman to GOP VP. That would've been too extreme. The plan was always for her to leave the party, spend two years preparing for this, and then have the time in between so she can transition into a politician on a Republican ticket. Note that I did not say she's necessarily even a republican.You're worried because she was on the list of the WEF or CFR? So am I. But it's impossible to find someone in DC who doesn't have something a bit questionable. She's done nothing the last 8 or 9 years to cause concern.-It's not about what you want. It's about what other Americans want that don't completely agree with you, but will share the country with you.-Destroying the Democratic Party is the number one objective. Not uniting the GOP. Trump hates the GOP. Tulsi Gabbard is the one that will bring the most people together from outside the GOP.-Look at her recent positions, such as calling for the deportation of all illegals. She's gearing up to join Trump on the ticket with these positions.-“Trump should pick a black guy like Tim Scott or Ben Carson to get the black vote!” That would be a great way in my opinion to lose the black vote. Trump is already blacker than those two and I’m not going to support pandering to a group of people based on their skin color. If Trump wants people in the black community to support him he’ll work with musicians and sports people who probably have more impact than some politician.-That being said(!), Trump picking a woman, especially one in her early 40s with no children, would drive the extreme leftist women insane. This would be funny. But also bring women to the ticket where he is lacking greatly.-Her military background is very notable, very admirable, and very legitimate. Remember, what did the Q drops consistently talk about – the military. She has been very consistent in her loyalty to the military, whether you like it or not. Whether you're worried she's a snake or not. That loyalty to the military is very important to this entire situation. Has Vivek or Ben Carson or any of these other people (with the exception of Mike Flynn – credit for that obviously) served in the military? Come on Q people, all you patriots and Q people and maga people who want Ben Carson and Vivek and these people for VP? Where is their military service? Where is it? That is very very important - and for a woman to have that background and having done that is unique and attractive.-Speaking of attractive, she is attractive. Not to be underestimated. And we know looks are important to Trump!-Lastly, and this is the most important policy for me: she is very very anti-war, especially anti-stupid war. We have killed millions of people by stupid wars in the last 30 to 40 years. And many more before that that are maybe not as relevant as our current foreign policy. She has always been against that. Consistently.-Let me reiterate, and this is the most important point. This is not about picking somebody who agrees with everything you say. This is not about somebody that you support completely. It's about somebody that will bring unity to the country. Trump is a dealmaker. He is first and foremost, a dealmaker. A good deal maker recognizes that you don't always get everything exactly as you want in a deal. But everybody should walk away with something and be fairly happy. That is what the art of the deal is all about.-Trump doesn't want to unite the GOP. He wants to unite the country. Ben Carson, Michael f'ing Flynn, Vivek Ramaswami, the rest of these idiot GOP governors - they are not going to unite the country. They are not going to bring people together, who are in the sort of classical liberal left like Glenn Greenwald or Tiabbi or Aaron Mate or Jimmy Dore - reasonable Americans, who may not agree with everything you want, but are definite worth working with. Those are the people they are going to be politically homeless and be frustrated if Trump picks somebody like this Dakota governor. Trump is smart. He knows how to make a deal. I think he's going to be Tulsi Gabbard because she is the one that will best bring people together.",

I just don't think Trump will trust him with his entire MAGA legacy , and that's not just in 2028 as it could be anytime as TRump is vulnerable to assassination as the country is in a cold civil war that's threatening to go hot, insomuch, the criminal Biden JUnta simply cannot afford to allow Trump ever back in the White House ; they would prefer civil war to that because they think they will win , but they are wrong about that too",

        "content": "-Tulsi Gabbard was sent on a mission by Trump and Steve Bannon in 2016 after he was elected. She went to Syria and met with Assad. The meeting with Trump was for optics to begin preparing people for her. The mission was something they wanted to see if she could do - which she completed.-She also ran for president in 2020, so she could practice on the debate stage and run a campaign. Part of the plan.-She had a mission given to her by Trump's team, which was to make Kamala Harris look terrible during the debate, which she did and completed. Another preparation for four years later.-Remember, she did not vote to impeach Trump. Remember, this has been planned years ago. It would've been too difficult for her to defend the position of impeaching Trump years later to be on his ticket. She took a lot of heat for not voting to impeach him. Remember, when that decision was made, they knew she was going to VP. It was a political decision.-She spoke at CPAC. Another step in her preparing her for VP. I mean, the woman f’ing vote spoke at CPAC! You really don't think they're planning on having her in Trumps administration at the very least?-“But she endorsed Biden!\" Exactly. So she can validate the people who have the arc where they came from supporting Biden, but realized Trump is better. That's very important. Do not assume that everybody always had to be the same as you.-She left the Democrat party two years ago and did not run for reelection. Why? Because she couldn't go from Democrat congresswoman to GOP VP. That would've been too extreme. The plan was always for her to leave the party, spend two years preparing for this, and then have the time in between so she can transition into a politician on a Republican ticket. Note that I did not say she's necessarily even a republican.-You're worried because she was on the list of the WEF or CFR? So am I. But it's impossible to find someone in DC who doesn't have something a bit questionable. She's done nothing the last 8 or 9 years to cause concern.-It's not about what you want. It's about what other Americans want that don't completely agree with you, but will share the country with you.-Destroying the Democratic Party is the number one objective. Not uniting the GOP. Trump hates the GOP. Tulsi Gabbard is the one that will bring the most people together from outside the GOP.-Look at her recent positions, such as calling for the deportation of all illegals. She's gearing up to join Trump on the ticket with these positions.-“Trump should pick a black guy like Tim Scott or Ben Carson to get the black vote!” That would be a great way in my opinion to lose the black vote. Trump is already blacker than those two and I’m not going to support pandering to a group of people based on their skin color. If Trump wants people in the black community to support him he’ll work with musicians and sports people who probably have more impact than some politician.-That being said(!), Trump picking a woman, especially one in her early 40s with no children, would drive the extreme leftist women insane. This would be funny. But also bring women to the ticket where he is lacking greatly.-Her military background is very notable, very admirable, and very legitimate. Remember, what did the Q drops consistently talk about – the military. She has been very consistent in her loyalty to the military, whether you like it or not. Whether you're worried she's a snake or not. That loyalty to the military is very important to this entire situation. Has Vivek or Ben Carson or any of these other people (with the exception of Mike Flynn – credit for that obviously) served in the military? Come on Q people, all you patriots and Q people and maga people who want Ben Carson and Vivek and these people for VP? Where is their military service? Where is it? That is very very important - and for a woman to have that background and having done that is unique and attractive.-Speaking of attractive, she is attractive. Not to be underestimated. And we know looks are important to Trump-Lastly, and this is the most important policy for me: she is very very anti-war, especially anti-stupid war. We have killed millions of people by stupid wars in the last 30 to 40 years. And many more before that that are maybe not as relevant as our current foreign policy. She has always been against that. Consistently.",

        "content": "-Tulsi Gabbard was sent on a mission by Trump and Steve Bannon in 2016 after he was elected. She went to Syria and met with Assad. The meeting with Trump was for optics to begin preparing people for her. The mission was something they wanted to see if she could do - which she completed.-She also ran for president in 2020, so she could practice on the debate stage and run a campaign. Part of the plan.-She had a mission given to her by Trump's team, which was to make Kamala Harris look terrible during the debate, which she did and completed. Another preparation for four years later.-Remember, she did not vote to impeach Trump. Remember, this has been planned years ago. It would've been too difficult for her to defend the position of impeaching Trump years later to be on his ticket. She took a lot of heat for not voting to impeach him. Remember, when that decision was made, they knew she was going to VP. It was a political decision.-She spoke at CPAC. Another step in her preparing her for VP. I mean, the woman f’ing vote spoke at CPAC! You really don't think they're planning on having her in Trumps administration at the very least?-“But she endorsed Biden!\" Exactly. So she can validate the people who have the arc where they came from supporting Biden, but realized Trump is better. That's very important. Do not assume that everybody always had to be the same as you.-She left the Democrat party two years ago and did not run for reelection. Why? Because she couldn't go from Democrat congresswoman to GOP VP. That would've been too extreme. The plan was always for her to leave the party, spend two years preparing for this, and then have the time in between so she can transition into a politician on a Republican ticket. Note that I did not say she's necessarily even a republican.-You're worried because she was on the list of the WEF or CFR? So am I. But it's impossible to find someone in DC who doesn't have something a bit questionable. She's done nothing the last 8 or 9 years to cause concern.-It's not about what you want. It's about what other Americans want that don't completely agree with you, but will share the country with you.-Destroying the Democratic Party is the number one objective. Not uniting the GOP. Trump hates the GOP. Tulsi Gabbard is the one that will bring the most people together from outside the GOP.-Look at her recent positions, such as calling for the deportation of all illegals. She's gearing up to join Trump on the ticket with these positions.-“Trump should pick a black guy like Tim Scott or Ben Carson to get the black vote!” That would be a great way in my opinion to lose the black vote. Trump is already blacker than those two and I’m not going to support pandering to a group of people based on their skin color. If Trump wants people in the black community to support him he’ll work with musicians and sports people who probably have more impact than some politician.-That being said(!), Trump picking a woman, especially one in her early 40s with no children, would drive the extreme leftist women insane. This would be funny. But also bring women to the ticket where he is lacking greatly.-Her military background is very notable, very admirable, and very legitimate. Remember, what did the Q drops consistently talk about – the military. She has been very consistent in her loyalty to the military, whether you like it or not. Whether you're worried she's a snake or not. That loyalty to the military is very important to this entire situation. Has Vivek or Ben Carson or any of these other people (with the exception of Mike Flynn – credit for that obviously) served in the military? Come on Q people, all you patriots and Q people and maga people who want Ben Carson and Vivek and these people for VP? Where is their military service? Where is it? That is very very important - and for a woman to have that background and having done that is unique and attractive.-Speaking of attractive, she is attractive. Not to be underestimated. And we know looks are important to Trump-Lastly, and this is the most important policy for me: she is very very anti-war, especially anti-stupid war. We have killed millions of people by stupid wars in the last 30 to 40 years. And many more before that that are maybe not as relevant as our current foreign policy. She has always been against that. Consistently.",

They'll probably swap Trump out in a year or two to bring back business as usual. It'll be political sleight of hand. There's no way he's been running for 2 years straight to come up with a list so uninspiring, and filled with Rinos, someone gave him that list. If that truly is the list, then it wouldn't surprise me if CNN and MSNBC actually wants Trump to win. Which bizarrely, seems like the play right now. It seems like if Trump gets elected he wants to play Patty-cake with the media again.  Much like the Vaccine  Trump pushed, we'll see if Trump is truly MAGA or not with this pick. If he does pick a Vance, he might win, but I almost guarantee Vance will be absolutely destroyed in 2028. He does not have the force of personality or in the insights to lead MAGA. And we already know his a hardcore Rino like Rubio, and Burgum (Though not as bad as Burgum). Flynn could lead MAGA, Vance, no chance. Everything that happened under Trump will just be lost to the wind. Picking Vance just pretty much confirms that he's no longer interested in attacking the media or \"5th generation warfare\" as Flynn calls it. We'll have to have another outsider pick up the torch and go at it like Trump because there's too many Rinos, who are virtually Dem-lites, in the GOP, just waiting in the wings.",

They'll probably swap Trump out in a year or two to bring back business as usual. It'll be political sleight of hand. There's no way he's been running for 2 years straight to come up with a list so uninspiring, and filled with Rinos, someone gave him that list. If that truly is the list, then it wouldn't surprise me if CNN and MSNBC actually wants Trump to win. Which bizarrely, seems like the play right now. It seems like if Trump gets elected he wants to play Patty-cake with the media again.  Much like the Vaccine  Trump pushed, we'll see if Trump is truly MAGA or not with this pick. If he does pick a Vance, he might win, but I almost guarantee Vance will be absolutely destroyed in 2028. He does not have the force of personality or in the insights to lead MAGA. And we already know his a hardcore Rino like Rubio, and Burgum (Though not as bad as Burgum). Flynn could lead MAGA, Vance, no chance. Everything that happened under Trump will just be lost to the wind. Picking Vance just pretty much confirms that he's no longer interested in attacking the media or \"5th generation warfare\" as Flynn calls it. We'll have to have another outsider pick up the torch and go at it like Trump because there's too many Rinos, who are virtually Dem-lites, in the GOP, just waiting in the wings.",
