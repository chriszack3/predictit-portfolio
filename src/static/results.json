                "opContent": "When the shift happens both on RCP and HQ polling averages too, the prices will change more. Same if the 538 Forecast moves. Right now the 538 Forecast is 50 out of 100 for both Biden and Trump. On RCP, Trump is +0.6 in the H2H and +0.9 in the 5 way. 538 doesn't do a national polling average for H2H. At least not that I have seen. They only included RFK Jr.Nationally, RFK Jr and Biden are splitting. A couple days ago, in the Fox News poll where they asked RFK Jr voted who they would vote for between, 47 percent said Trump, 47 percent said Biden. The difference is RFK Jr pulls more from Biden than Trump in Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. Whereas, RFK Jr pulls more from Trump than Biden in Wisconsin and Michigan, and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania and Arizona.Generally speaking, the more white and more college educated share of a Democratic polling share is, he is less supported by Dems, relative to the GOP. His support comes more from low information voters. Luckily for Biden, the Dem voting share is whiter and more college educated in PA, MI, WI, NE CD 02, MN and AZ. Because all of those minus AZ equal exactly 270 EVs. And Arizona though going Trump right now is closer than all of the others, and has 11 EVs, as a back up to WI (10 EVs, which was the tipping state in both '16 and '20).For Biden, I would say the bigger issue is that somewhat with Stein but even more with Cornel West, those voters if they were to vote in the 2 way, would be more likely to go Biden. The two of them probably will combined not get more than the same 1.7-1.8 percent 3rd party candidates received in all elections between 2000 to 2020, excluding 2016. Whereas with RFK Jr, it's more unique to see a 3rd party candidate pulling equally from both a Dem and GOP presidential candidate.If Stein and C. West for example together take 1.1 out of that 1.8 that would have gone to Biden and only 0.5 from Trump, that 0.6 percent could be very important in the upper Midwest. Especially in states where C. West has tried appealing to Muslim voters with pro Palestine rhetoric, like Michigan and to a lesser extent Minnesota.As that relates to your question, without having the 5 way poll, it means the polling averages both nationally and state level, will slant a little more towards Biden than Trump. Whereas Biden is +0.1 in the 3 way 538 national average, Trump is +0.9 in the 5 way. That is a gap of 1.0 percent.However, that theory may be wrong too, because with HQ in their 3 way without Stein and West, it's +0.9 Trump as well.With Wisconsin and Michigan, it's all running at or less than 1 percent, or even less than a half percent, whether H2H, 3 way or 5 way, on multiple of RCP, HQ and 538. There isn't enough polling data coming out of Minnesota or Nebraska CD 02, but it's usually so that it runs more blue than MI WI PA. With more polling come out of there, it may give Biden a slight boost in gambling markets by a cent or two.Between RCP, 538 and HQ, whether 2 way, 3 way or 5 way, Pennsylvania is ranging from +1.3 to +2.9 Trump. The  +2.9 outlier is the 5 way RCP. Everything else between all of HQ, 538 and RCP, doesn't go above +2.0 for Trump.When you see Pennsylvania's polling averages move to where Wisconsin and Michigan, which is likely to occur after Biden holds his own or better in the debate like he always has and after Trump's sentencing, you'll start to see this move. On Polymarkets, PA has been slightly leading Biden for a while now.In both '16 and '20, PA was not the tipping state. It was Pennsylvania predicted by experts both times with Wisconsin as the other possibility. And lots of people both times predicted it would be PA. Turned out being WI as tpping state.  With a more popular Dem governor than last time, along with PA having elected a Dem senator since, I don't see PA being more to the right than WI, or WI being more to the left. At best, even.",

If you look at the RCP, 538 or HQ average, if looking at MI, PA and WI, they are all having polling averages that are very close to national average now. This wasn't anywhere near the case with Biden in 2020. It's because these three states have not shifted as right relative to national average as NV, AZ, GA and NC have. It is also because in the upper rustbelt RFK takes more from Trump than Biden, whereas RFK takes more from Biden in the sunbelt and slightly more in other regions in the US.MI and WI now run slightly left to the national average, with or without RFK Jr included. MI is running about even H2H, while running slightly blue with RFK Jr on the ballot. WI is also running even. Or on HQ, +2.4 Biden with RFK. With Pennsylvania, it's +1.0 Trump  with RFK Jr, or +1.7 without him, on HQ.Trump is +0.8 on the polling averages. You'd literally have to use the best case scenario in PA on RCP with RFK included for +3.0, for it to be a +2.2 right awing from the national popular vote average. If HQ is correct, then it is +0.2 that Dems would need to win by to secure getting to 270 with PA, MI and WI.So if Fox News is indeed correct which you seem to be accepting of and not arguing against, you are comfortable with the idea of the Dems only needing anywhere from +0.2 to +2.2 to win.You do realize how much Trump was of a failure as a president going against an incumbent with approval on the high 30s you are accepting those polls are fact implying that it is basically 50/50 and decided by 43,000 votes to 77,000 votes in 3 states again like 2016 and 2020, right? In the past, you would have complained the polls were fake. Yet look at the pretzel you talked yourself in to with liking the polls now.Just wait until it is the Republican party of NE you wind up blaming for Trump losing in 2024 when Biden wins exactly 270. You should screen shot that.",

The issue with RCP is they have included right wing bias garbage companies that get D or F ratings like Traflagar.It is a close election. Just like 2016 and 2020. People mostly will be voting the same way they did last time and the time before that. It is hyoerpartisan times. Whether Biden is +2, Trump is +1, or they are even, in nationally polling, is generally not important. What is important is what the polling averages say in MI, WI and PA. Probably MN too but it seems very unrealistic for Trump to win NE 02 or MN without taking at least one or more of MI, WI and PA. This is where the math to get to 270 is. AZ is a back up plan to if Biden slightly loses WI. GA is the back up to MI. GA + NV would be the back up to PA. It's less reliable pathways in either case. They shouod keep canpaigning heavily there along with FL and NC to get the GOP to waste resources playing defense.Even RCP has Biden even with Trump in MI now and slightly leading with RFK, Stein and West included. It's slightly to Biden on RCP in WI, but better on 538 and a bit better better than not Biden on HQ. Slightly too with MI. PA right now seems to be a little more challenging than the other two. The good thing for Biden is Shapiro is more popular than Whitmer and Evers. There are a lot of black voters in Philly and Pittsburgh who like in previous elections will come home.",

So much of those inroads the GOP is really counting on making with black voters seem to be diminishing.Meanwhile, the FOXNEWS poll said Biden has a +15 favorability from elderly voters age 65+. This has consistently been America's most consistent high voting demographic for decades. This same Fox poll has Biden up +28 with college educated women. They show up in high percentages to vote too. Biden's score in the polls are also up a little bit from where it previously was on the economy and immigration.Trump supporters, this is coming from Fox News. Because it's reporting data, it must all be fake news, right? So you can't deny the credibility of the poll. So what other option is there? Ah, silence. Classic for those who hate America by flying upside down American flags like Alito's wife. We have soldiers fighting for your freedom for that flag while you support a fat coward who criticizes war veterans as not heroes. This hatred of America waving upside down flags is classic for those who hate police who say nothing in defense of the numbers of police that were severely injured on Jan 6 due to a bunch of QAnon'ers who largely have been prosecuted and rightfully so.",

Which seems to do nothing with the middle.Trump practically is a socialist. When his trade war woth China was skyrocketing the cost on agricultural goods and metals bankrupting by farmers in ruby red Midwestern states by the drove, he went full Lenin on giving a huge socialist type package to farmers. Talk about a socialist inflationist.Trump was in practice as big a spender as a socialist. The national debt grew in greater proportion by Trump in one term relative to Obama's two terms. Trump said he would eliminate the national debt in 8 years. He had the same build up of national debt or worse relative to Obama. And you wonder how that, a recession, racial unrest he could not manage and a million Covid deaths in about 9 months (the highest per capita of any industrialized country) led to him ending as a one term loser with an approval average never getting out of the 40s at any point during his presidency and staying low 40s for most of it?The dude spends out of his you know what. You and I know that's not the conservative way.Trump approved stimulus packages for the public. If he does it, you say it's amazing and considerate for the people. If Biden does it, even a couple months ago, and you call him a Marxist or Leninist. You really think undecided voters in the upper rest belt don't know the difference between when you guys play politics or not? Go ahead, ask those +15 supporting Biden who are age 65+, according to yesterday's June poll on your beloved Fox News that kisses Trump's butt on the regularTrump won them 50-48 last time and is now losing this bloc where 2/3 of them vote in droves. Yet you guys are going wild over over gains made with younger voters that are already coming home to Dems and voters 18-29 have barely even 1/4 turnout. And when turnout is low, they turn out guess. Guess who consistently still turns out though? Elderly voters and women in the suburbs, especially white women and especially women with college education. You'll love to meet those Philly and Pittsburgh suburban voters on the PA side, those suburban voter in and around Detroit, and in and around Trump's horrible Milwaukee come early November.",

As though you calling anything laughable matters to any reader on here? You talk about the point at hand so you can convince people. No one is because convinced off yoir reputation on here. Look at the responses and consistent negative votes outnumbered positive votes you get on here.Trump could have blocked the COVID bills. You know what makes Trump the biggest wimp? He has promoted skepticism against the COVID vaccine directly while simultaneously trying to take credit for it. He is trying to play both sides within Republicans. Yet they don't believe he is a politician when that is exactly what a politician does. He tells the sensible moderate Republicans take the vaccine I helped lead the creation of, while pandering to the other half with conspiracy theories. It didn't make those conspiracy theorist end folks in the GOP happy either. But what did they do? Shut their mouths like cowards and mostly still show up to vote. With the progressive leftist end supporting Palestine, they'll mostly be voting for Biden too on the basis of the level of two evils they'll go with. But at least they have the courage to call Biden out.What did the idiot Facebooking conservative mom who loves the idea that autism is caused by vaccines gave to say against Trump when Trump bragged he created the vaccine and everyone should get it? Nothing. You know why? Because if you standing on line for that Kool Aid in late 1970s Guyana and you turn around and criticize what is in the punch, everyone calls you disloyal and worthless and won't associate with you. Meanwhile, pro Israel moderate Dems keep working with their pro Palestinian wing of the party and respect their freedom of speech.Trump had the choice not to sign those socialist COVID stimulus checks. It was his pen. He did it because at the time he thought that's politically what the middle wanted.Why didn't you answer the point about Trump ending with a national deficit significantly higher? On same proportion as Obama. He promised to end the war in Afghanistan but was too cowardly to have the courage to end it because of the bad optics that would come so he continued to cost American lives in a war going no where for 4 more years, while continuing to burden the tax payer.Trump enabled those 23 Democratic governors to shut down their economies. His voice influenced what the other 27 governors did. The issue was Trump couldn't make up his mind. His political inexperience and general indecisiveness was showing. His own staff said he was too lazy to read his briefings. When you flip flop saying to shut down one day, that we should open the next day, the vaccines are bad one day, that they are amazing the next day, this confuses everyone. As much as I think RFK Jr is a buffoon, at least he remains consistent. At least he knows he will take flack for ridiculous statements and doesn't cry like a baby when he gets called out on it like Trump.",

Has nothing to do with Kelly. He also disrespected the Khan gold star family. He has disrespected service people by saying he would fix the VA when he did nothing and even in the 2020 election continued to complain how much of a mess it was. He was part of why it was never fixed just like he was the a big part of the reason a new Iran deal never happened as promised, why the ACA was never repealed nor replaced despite having a GOP led house and senate for 2 years, and his disrespecting of McCain probably had a lot to do with that critical vote too), why an infrastructure deal never happened despite having a GOP led House and Senate for 2 years (meanwhile Biden got Mitch on board to get it done while barely having a majority in the senate), why North Korea never denuclearized as promised (and how he embarrassed our country by saying Kim Jung Un - a guy who tortures and starves his people, including feeding his own uncle to dogs, is a man with a beautiful vision, while his prison guards tortured a US citizen in Otto Warmbier, with NK refused to take any responsibility for). He also lied saying that the national deficit would get wiped out under him, yet he by proportion accrued more debt in 1 term than Obama.He honestly really did not accomplish much. Just the run of the mill GOP Reagen or Bush type tax cuts, following inheriting an economy with 7+ years from Obama and 5.0 percent unemployment, all to end his term with 6.3 percent unemployment in a recession. Besides that, the only other thing he did was get gun reform started, which actually was something Democrats wanted, not Republicans. Which Republicans cowered on that and couldn't stand up to Koresh on that. I'll give him that he got 3 Supreme Court justices on, but that really had more to do with McConnell and timing. Everything else was drama, chaos and failure. He was too thin skinned to hold it together once the Mueller investigation was going. As president, investigations happen. You shut your mouth, govern and keep the ball moving. All he did was whine. Whining is nor productive. It doesn't make any more people join you than we're already with you. It just annoys the people not on your side and even makes people roll their eyes on his side and say can we move on to the issues. He just does not have the ability to focus. He wouldn't even read his briefings. He is a showman who blows hot air and half butts it on everything. Jewish voters in NYC know exactly the type of person he has been for decades. They were liberals who did not appreciate him saying the central park 5 should be executed and had nothing to say when their convictions were overturned.Born with a golden spoon, not having to work for crap in his life. Inherited the equivalent of 391 million. Did not pay taxes and went bankrupt 6 times because he couldn't effectively run his businesses. Would have made more just sitting on the real estate and interest. Pretty sad when you think about it. This is his character. 60 percent of America knows it and believes it. About 5 to 7 percent knows it but will vote for him or RFK Jr as a means to not vote Biden or for most Dems.Regarding about +15 on the elderly approval of Biden which I appreciate you acknowledging, what I was getting at with that is that number is higher than he received by a good margin compared to 2020. Trump won the elderly vote 50-48 in 2020. So if Biden is running a +15 with them, that's a good sign for him. As opposed to the black disapproval for Biden fluctuating all over the place and polls showing a predictable coming home effect back to Dems now. Same with Latino voters in varying states to a lesser extent.",

All of New York, New Jersey, Florida (for GOP), Arizona (Biden does not need it to win because MI, WI, PA, MN and NE 02 are running very left of AZ, NV, GA and NC, yet with all those states gets to exactly 270), plus Massachussetts, California and Illinois, are all very blue, we already know will be red, or are purple but not going to construct in how Biden hits 270 in the most winnable path The Jewish population in PA, MI and WI are small. What, like 2-3 percent each? PA even has a Jewish Dem governor with high approval and he is moderate. Even if the overwhelming majority of Jews voted red in your supposed hypothesis, it would not be enough in any of those very blue states to electorally matter. The reality is though the polling doesn't support that any of those states competitive for Republicans. And the data has shown that the Jewish disapproval of Trump is extremely high. And that the Jewish favorability of Trump is low.Do you know how many of these mainstream media companies, and social media companies have Jewish owners or leadership or journalists? If what you are implying is true about Jewish voters going red, why is there no articles or data being published supporting this argument? What would be in it for the media to suppress that article, but not one about possible erosion woth younger, black or Latino voters? For Jewish voters, the rate of having a college education is higher than the average of the US. This contributes to being higher information voters and more complex voters taking a diversity of issues in to consideration when voting. Education rates are higher in the community compared relatively to national average. The political partisanship of most of these individuals historically has been liberal. Jewish people have had to fight that discrimination from conservatives for years for this.Jewish leaders were and have been on the Frontline of the Civil Rights movement. They have been part of the leadership of labor rights movements. Bernie Sanders is iconic to this today and he himself is Jewish. Jewish leaders have disproportionately been part of the Democrat party more than the Republican party. They are now much more educated than the average of the general population, and those with higher education are now currently the bedrock of the moderate Democrats who silently back candidates like Obama, Clinton and Biden, day in and day out.If Jewish voters were breaking towards Trump, where is the data? Talking to your family and friends in your bias political circle is not evidence. Show me the data. You really believe this wouldn't be a story if it were true. It's a story if Muslims in Michigan do a protest primary vote against Biden, its a story if black voters disapprove of Biden in higher numbers in the past, and it's a story if Biden struggled with Latinos. But it is not a story if Jewish voters are breaking towards Trump in these supposed record numbers you are telling us about? Despite there being many Jewish journalist reporters who probably would have a ton of interest in this, especially in NYC, where you obsessed with this the most?So Jewish voters are going to turn their backs on the labor movement, on unions, on Universal health care or ACA pushes, LGBTQ rights, Ukraine (who has a Jewish president, going against Russia who has had a long history of antisemitism), Jewish women will turn their backs on reproductive rights, and so on?  All to join a presidential candidate in Trump who has had a history to pandering to anti Semitic tropes such as saying \"both sides had some fine people\" in Charlottesville? You do realize they were literally on national TV chanting \"Jews will not replace us?\" While holding torches up. You do realize Jewish voters are much higher information voters than the average and they were well aware of this in 2020 when voting heavily for Biden? Anti semitism grew during the Trump Admin. Synongauges ending up with graffiti on the daily. Go ahead and look on Google yourself with the dates from the Trump Admin.I recommend you discussing with those not politically aligned to you, but close to you, if there are any, because you are too close to the issue to think objectively about it. You either are or are closely related to a small number of Jewish voters who have made up their mind about Israel and voting. What you are not realizing is actually simple though. It's that on policy, Biden and Trump are similar on Israel. At least as it pertains to this war. And Biden and Trump have both had their criticism of Netanyahu which is honestly nothing compared to the average Israeli. The logic most Jewish Democrats or Dem leaning Independents apply here is that policy on the conflict in Hamas is not changing even if there is a change in Admin. Most I've spoken have said they'd expect antisemitism to embolden because Trump has been welcoming to white supremacists, such as telling the Proud Boys to stand by and stand back. In a debate of all places.Trump has also spoken well of QAnon which promotes antisemitic conspiracy theories involving Jewish elites, including the Rothchilds and Soros. And Marjorie's space lasers.When Trump called Jewish voters disloyal for heavily voting Democrat, his favorability went down double digits from in the 70s to the 80s in a poll. The polls only count if you like what they say though, otherwise it's fake news, right?Trump called the Israeli Jewish Council brutal killers and he told them they had no other choice to vote for him in 2019. Sounds like the nonsense he spews today. How'd that work out in 2020? About in 10 Jewish voters voting for Biden? Google the Assiciated Press article. It says in 2020, 69 percent voted for Biden. 73 percent said they thought Trump has had too much tolerance for extremist hate groups.High educated voters than the average are higher information voters who go deeper with more complex reasoning and critical thinking. They are not one issue voters. Most voters have at least 3-5+ issues on their mind they are voting on. For most Jewish voters,",

His approval average on RCP within days went to 37-38 percent due to that. When you say neo Nazis are part of some fine people, that is what happens. Those midterm voters in 2018 and presidential election voters in 2020 certainly remembered it. Biden even launched his campaign saying it was that moment he decided he needed to run against Trump.What exactly is the logic behind you saying every day is Charlottesville under Biden? If you don't elaborate, people will call you an idiot. It's like the equivalent of saying if you eat McDonalds 4 days a week, you will lose weight. Things are much more calm and less chaotic under Biden.Where are there these riots or protests in the street you are talking about? Charlottesville was supposedly unite the right versus Antifa? Where are these two groups currently fighting it out? Internet message boards? Facebook? Lol Even social media and misinformation right wing OANs and Newsmax type networks aren't claiming they are interacting in person.You are probably seeing your Republican voting dad, brother and cousins screaming in the living room at their TV or phone every night about how Biden is the worse thing on earth. That's not the equivalent of Charlottesville, buddy.",

You understand there are some battles you may lose but you learn from it to try to do better the next time.In Trump's philosophy, he is not allowed to ever lose. It's either he won or he won. His ego is too thin skinned for politics. He has psychological issues that interfere with his ability to accept you can't control what others think about you. It's like he is permanently in the state of mind of a mentally unstable 14 year old girl who loses it every time someone says something mean about her.When you are a president, a manager, a military general, a teacher, a doctor, or anyone with authority, being criticized by those with less power is part of the game.
