                "opContent": "When the shift happens both on RCP and HQ polling averages too, the prices will change more. Same if the 538 Forecast moves. Right now the 538 Forecast is 50 out of 100 for both Biden and Trump. On RCP, Trump is +0.6 in the H2H and +0.9 in the 5 way. 538 doesn't do a national polling average for H2H. At least not that I have seen. They only included RFK Jr.Nationally, RFK Jr and Biden are splitting. A couple days ago, in the Fox News poll where they asked RFK Jr voted who they would vote for between, 47 percent said Trump, 47 percent said Biden. The difference is RFK Jr pulls more from Biden than Trump in Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. Whereas, RFK Jr pulls more from Trump than Biden in Wisconsin and Michigan, and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania and Arizona.Generally speaking, the more white and more college educated share of a Democratic polling share is, he is less supported by Dems, relative to the GOP. His support comes more from low information voters. Luckily for Biden, the Dem voting share is whiter and more college educated in PA, MI, WI, NE CD 02, MN and AZ. Because all of those minus AZ equal exactly 270 EVs. And Arizona though going Trump right now is closer than all of the others, and has 11 EVs, as a back up to WI (10 EVs, which was the tipping state in both '16 and '20).For Biden, I would say the bigger issue is that somewhat with Stein but even more with Cornel West, those voters if they were to vote in the 2 way, would be more likely to go Biden. The two of them probably will combined not get more than the same 1.7-1.8 percent 3rd party candidates received in all elections between 2000 to 2020, excluding 2016. Whereas with RFK Jr, it's more unique to see a 3rd party candidate pulling equally from both a Dem and GOP presidential candidate.If Stein and C. West for example together take 1.1 out of that 1.8 that would have gone to Biden and only 0.5 from Trump, that 0.6 percent could be very important in the upper Midwest. Especially in states where C. West has tried appealing to Muslim voters with pro Palestine rhetoric, like Michigan and to a lesser extent Minnesota.As that relates to your question, without having the 5 way poll, it means the polling averages both nationally and state level, will slant a little more towards Biden than Trump. Whereas Biden is +0.1 in the 3 way 538 national average, Trump is +0.9 in the 5 way. That is a gap of 1.0 percent.However, that theory may be wrong too, because with HQ in their 3 way without Stein and West, it's +0.9 Trump as well.With Wisconsin and Michigan, it's all running at or less than 1 percent, or even less than a half percent, whether H2H, 3 way or 5 way, on multiple of RCP, HQ and 538. There isn't enough polling data coming out of Minnesota or Nebraska CD 02, but it's usually so that it runs more blue than MI WI PA. With more polling come out of there, it may give Biden a slight boost in gambling markets by a cent or two.Between RCP, 538 and HQ, whether 2 way, 3 way or 5 way, Pennsylvania is ranging from +1.3 to +2.9 Trump. The  +2.9 outlier is the 5 way RCP. Everything else between all of HQ, 538 and RCP, doesn't go above +2.0 for Trump.When you see Pennsylvania's polling averages move to where Wisconsin and Michigan, which is likely to occur after Biden holds his own or better in the debate like he always has and after Trump's sentencing, you'll start to see this move. On Polymarkets, PA has been slightly leading Biden for a while now.In both '16 and '20, PA was not the tipping state. It was Pennsylvania both times with Wisconsin as the other possibility. And lots of people both times predicted it would be Wisconsin. With a more popular Dem governor than last time, along with PA having elected a Dem senator since, I don't see PA being more to the right than WI, or WI being more to the left. At best, even.see more",

It is also because in the upper rustbelt RFK takes more from Trump than Biden, whereas RFK takes more from Biden in the sunbelt and slightly more in other regions in the US.MI and WI now run slightly left to the national average, with or without RFK Jr included. MI is running about even H2H, while running slightly blue with RFK Jr on the ballot. WI is also running even. Or on HQ, +2.4 Biden with RFK. With Pennsylvania, it's +1.0 Trump  with RFK Jr, or +1.7 without him, on HQ.Trump is +0.8 on the polling averages. You'd literally have to use the best case scenario in PA on RCP with RFK included for +3.0, for it to be a +2.2 right awing from the national popular vote average. If HQ is correct, then it is +0.2 that Dems would need to win by to secure getting to 270 with PA, MI and WI.So if Fox News is indeed correct which you seem to be accepting of and not arguing against, you are comfortable with the idea of the Dems only needing anywhere from +0.2 to +2.2 to win.You do realize how much Trump was of a failure as a president going against an incumbent with approval on the high 30s you are accepting those polls are fact implying that it is basically 50/50 and decided by 43,000 votes to 77,000 votes in 3 states again like 2016 and 2020, right? In the past, you would have complained the polls were fake. Yet look at the pretzel you talked yourself in to with liking the polls now.Just wait until it is the Republican party of NE you wind up blaming for Trump losing in 2024 when Biden wins exactly 270. You should screen shot that.see more",

People mostly will be voting the same way they did last time and the time before that. It is hyoerpartisan times. Whether Biden is +2, Trump is +1, or they are even, in nationally polling, is generally not important. What is important is what the polling averages say in MI, WI and PA. Probably MN too but it seems very unrealistic for Trump to win NE 02 or MN without taking at least one or more of MI, WI and PA. This is where the math to get to 270 is. AZ is a back up plan to if Biden slightly loses WI. GA is the back up to MI. GA + NV would be the back up to PA. It's less reliable pathways in either case. They shouod keep canpaigning heavily there along with FL and NC to get the GOP to waste resources playing defense.Even RCP has Biden even with Trump in MI now and slightly leading with RFK, Stein and West included. It's slightly to Biden on RCP in WI, but better on 538 and a bit better better than not Biden on HQ. Slightly too with MI. PA right now seems to be a little more challenging than the other two. The good thing for Biden is Shapiro is more popular than Whitmer and Evers. There are a lot of black voters in Philly and Pittsburgh who like in previous elections will come home.see more",

Biden's score in the polls are also up a little bit from where it previously was on the economy and immigration.Trump supporters, this is coming from Fox News.

Which seems to do nothing with the middle.Trump practically is a socialist. When his trade war woth China was skyrocketing the cost on agricultural goods and metals bankrupting by farmers in ruby red Midwestern states by the drove, he went full Lenin on giving a huge socialist type package to farmers. Talk about a socialist inflationist.Trump was in practice as big a spender as a socialist. The national debt grew in greater proportion by Trump in one term relative to Obama's two terms. Trump said he would eliminate the national debt in 8 years. He had the same build up of national debt or worse relative to Obama. And you wonder how that, a recession, racial unrest he could not manage and a million Covid deaths in about 9 months (the highest per capita of any industrialized country) led to him ending as a one term loser with an approval average never getting out of the 40s at any point during his presidency and staying low 40s for most of it?The dude spends out of his you know what. You and I know that's not the conservative way.Trump approved stimulus packages for the public. If he does it, you say it's amazing and considerate for the people. If Biden does it, even a couple months ago, and you call him a Marxist or Leninist.

Yet you guys are going wild over over gains made with younger voters that are already coming home to Dems and voters 18-29 have barely even 1/4 turnout. And when turnout is low, they turn out guess. Guess who consistently still turns out though? Elderly voters and women in the suburbs, especially white women and especially women with college education.

He has promoted skepticism against the COVID vaccine directly while simultaneously trying to take credit for it. He is trying to play both sides within Republicans. Yet they don't believe he is a politician when that is exactly what a politician does. He tells the sensible moderate Republicans take the vaccine I helped lead the creation of, while pandering to the other half with conspiracy theories. It didn't make those conspiracy theorist end folks in the GOP happy either. But what did they do? Shut their mouths like cowards and mostly still show up to vote. With the progressive leftist end supporting Palestine, they'll mostly be voting for Biden too on the basis of the level of two evils they'll go with. But at least they have the courage to call Biden out.What did the idiot Facebooking conservative mom who loves the idea that autism is caused by vaccines gave to say against Trump when Trump bragged he created the vaccine and everyone should get it? Nothing. You know why? Because if you standing on line for that Kool Aid in late 1970s Guyana and you turn around and criticize what is in the punch, everyone calls you disloyal and worthless and won't associate with you. Meanwhile, pro Israel moderate Dems keep working with their pro Palestinian wing of the party and respect their freedom of speech.Trump had the choice not to sign those socialist COVID stimulus checks. It was his pen. He did it because at the time he thought that's politically what the middle wanted.Why didn't you answer the point about Trump ending with a national deficit significantly higher? On same proportion as Obama. He promised to end the war in Afghanistan but was too cowardly to have the courage to end it because of the bad optics that would come so he continued to cost American lives in a war going no where for 4 more years, while continuing to burden the tax payer.Trump enabled those 23 Democratic governors to shut down their economies. His voice influenced what the other 27 governors did. The issue was Trump couldn't make up his mind. His political inexperience and general indecisiveness was showing. His own staff said he was too lazy to read his briefings. When you flip flop saying to shut down one day, that we should open the next day, the vaccines are bad one day, that they are amazing the next day, this confuses everyone. As much as I think RFK Jr is a buffoon, at least he remains consistent. At least he knows he will take flack for ridiculous statements and doesn't cry like a baby when he gets called out on it like Trump.see more",

Has nothing to do with Kelly. He also disrespected the Khan gold star family. He has disrespected service people by saying he would fix the VA when he did nothing and even in the 2020 election continued to complain how much of a mess it was. He was part of why it was never fixed just like he was the a big part of the reason a new Iran deal never happened as promised, why the ACA was never repealed nor replaced despite having a GOP led house and senate for 2 years, and his disrespecting of McCain probably had a lot to do with that critical vote too), why an infrastructure deal never happened despite having a GOP led House and Senate for 2 years (meanwhile Biden got Mitch on board to get it done while barely having a majority in the senate), why North Korea never denuclearized as promised (and how he embarrassed our country by saying Kim Jung Un - a guy who tortures and starves his people, including feeding his own uncle to dogs, is a man with a beautiful vision, while his prison guards tortured a US citizen in Otto Warmbier, with NK refused to take any responsibility for). He also lied saying that the national deficit would get wiped out under him, yet he by proportion accrued more debt in 1 term than Obama.He honestly really did not accomplish much. Just the run of the mill GOP Reagen or Bush type tax cuts, following inheriting an economy with 7+ years from Obama and 5.0 percent unemployment, all to end his term with 6.3 percent unemployment in a recession. Besides that, the only other thing he did was get gun reform started, which actually was something Democrats wanted, not Republicans. Which Republicans cowered on that and couldn't stand up to Koresh on that. I'll give him that he got 3 Supreme Court justices on, but that really had more to do with McConnell and timing. Everything else was drama, chaos and failure. He was too thin skinned to hold it together once the Mueller investigation was going. As president, investigations happen. You shut your mouth, govern and keep the ball moving. All he did was whine. Whining is nor productive. It doesn't make any more people join you than we're already with you. It just annoys the people not on your side and even makes people roll their eyes on his side and say can we move on to the issues. He just does not have the ability to focus. He wouldn't even read his briefings. He is a showman who blows hot air and half butts it on everything. Jewish voters in NYC know exactly the type of person he has been for decades. They were liberals who did not appreciate him saying the central park 5 should be executed and had nothing to say when their convictions were overturned.Born with a golden spoon, not having to work for crap in his life. Inherited the equivalent of 391 million. Did not pay taxes and went bankrupt 6 times because he couldn't effectively run his businesses. Would have made more just sitting on the real estate and interest. Pretty sad when you think about it. This is his character. 60 percent of America knows it and believes it. About 5 to 7 percent knows it but will vote for him or RFK Jr as a means to not vote Biden or for most Dems.Regarding about +15 on the elderly approval of Biden which I appreciate you acknowledging, what I was getting at with that is that number is higher than he received by a good margin compared to 2020. Trump won the elderly vote 50-48 in 2020. So if Biden is running a +15 with them, that's a good sign for him. As opposed to the black disapproval for Biden fluctuating all over the place and polls showing a predictable coming home effect back to Dems now.

Because they can't make up their mind with Fox News. Conservatives love watching their Fox and Friends, or Watters giving Trump a colonoscopy daily with his face, or Gutfeld acting like a buffoon. But, when they start putting out polls that Trump and his base don't like, then it's fake news, right? When they call AZ ahead of everyone else by days and even the election itself as soon as it could even to liberals surprise, than it's fake news again, right?The fake news argument doesn't work with Independents, moderates and undecided voters. It's just a rah rah rally around thing for conservatives to have a partisan talking point on.We have discussed other topics on here and I do know you make a concerted effort to have a conversation with a respectful overtone even when we disagree, which I do appreciate.What I think you really are misunderstanding is a few fundamental realities that is clouding your judgement. You should ask people close to you, but not Jewish, and ideally not sharing your same political partisanship, if you disagree with me.Like it or not, Jewish Americans are a relatively small demographic bloc that is disproportionately populated in very liberal cities and Metropolitan areas. All of New York, New Jersey, Florida (for GOP), Arizona (Biden does not need it to win because MI, WI, PA, MN and NE 02 are running very left of AZ, NV, GA and NC, yet with all those states gets to exactly 270), plus Massachussetts, California and Illinois, are all very blue, we already know will be red, or are purple but not going to construct in how Biden hits 270 in the most winnable path The Jewish population in PA, MI and WI are small. What, like 2-3 percent each? PA even has a Jewish Dem governor with high approval and he is moderate. Even if the overwhelming majority of Jews voted red in your supposed hypothesis, it would not be enough in any of those very blue states to electorally matter. The reality is though the polling doesn't support that any of those states competitive for Republicans. And the data has shown that the Jewish disapproval of Trump is extremely high. And that the Jewish favorability of Trump is low.Do you know how many of these mainstream media companies, and social media companies have Jewish owners or leadership or journalists? If what you are implying is true about Jewish voters going red, why is there no articles or data being published supporting this argument? What would be in it for the media to suppress that article, but not one about possible erosion woth younger, black or Latino voters? For Jewish voters, the rate of having a college education is higher than the average of the US. This contributes to being higher information voters and more complex voters taking a diversity of issues in to consideration when voting. Education rates are higher in the community compared relatively to national average. The political partisanship of most of these individuals historically has been liberal. Jewish people have had to fight that discrimination from conservatives for years for this.Jewish leaders were and have been on the Frontline of the Civil Rights movement. They have been part of the leadership of labor rights movements. Bernie Sanders is iconic to this today and he himself is Jewish. Jewish leaders have disproportionately been part of the Democrat party more than the Republican party. They are now much more educated than the average of the general population, and those with higher education are now currently the bedrock of the moderate Democrats who silently back candidates like Obama, Clinton and Biden, day in and day out.If Jewish voters were breaking towards Trump, where is the data? Talking to your family and friends in your bias political circle is not evidence. Show me the data. You really believe this wouldn't be a story if it were true. It's a story if Muslims in Michigan do a protest primary vote against Biden, its a story if black voters disapprove of Biden in higher numbers in the past, and it's a story if Biden struggled with Latinos. But it is not a story if Jewish voters are breaking towards Trump in these supposed record numbers you are telling us about? Despite there being many Jewish journalist reporters who probably would have a ton of interest in this, especially in NYC, where you obsessed with this the most?So Jewish voters are going to turn their backs on the labor movement, on unions, on Universal health care or ACA pushes, LGBTQ rights, Ukraine (who has a Jewish president, going against Russia who has had a long history of antisemitism), Jewish women will turn their backs on reproductive rights, and so on?  All to join a presidential candidate in Trump who has had a history to pandering to anti Semitic tropes such as saying \"both sides had some fine people\" in Charlottesville? You do realize they were literally on national TV chanting \"Jews will not replace us?\" While holding torches up. You do realize Jewish voters are much higher information voters than the average and they were well aware of this in 2020 when voting heavily for Biden? Anti semitism grew during the Trump Admin. Synongauges ending up with graffiti on the daily. Go ahead and look on Google yourself with the dates from the Trump Admin.I recommend you discussing with those not politically aligned to you, but close to you, if there are any, because you are too close to the issue to think objectively about it. You either are or are closely related to a small number of Jewish voters who have made up their mind about Israel and voting. What you are not realizing is actually simple though. It's that on policy, Biden and Trump are similar on Israel. At least as it pertains to this war. And Biden and Trump have both had their criticism of Netanyahu which is honestly nothing compared to the average Israeli. The logic most Jewish Democrats or Dem leaning Independents apply here is that policy on the conflict in Hamas is not changing even if there is a change in Admin. Most I've spoken have said they'd expect antisemitism to embolden because Trump has been welcoming to white supremacists, such as telling the Proud Boys to stand by and stand back. In a debate of all places.Trump has also spoken well of QAnon which promotes antisemitic conspiracy theories involving Jewish elites, including the Rothchilds and Soros. And Marjorie's space lasers.When Trump called Jewish voters disloyal for heavily voting Democrat, his favorability went down double digits from in the 70s to the 80s in a poll. The polls only count if you like what they say though, otherwise it's fake news, right?Trump called the Israeli Jewish Council brutal killers and he told them they had no other choice to vote for him in 2019. Sounds like the nonsense he spews today. How'd that work out in 2020? About in 10 Jewish voters voting for Biden? Google the Assiciated Press article. It says in 2020, 69 percent voted for Biden. 73 percent said they thought Trump has had too much tolerance for extremist hate groups.High educated voters than the average are higher information voters who go deeper with more complex reasoning and critical thinking. They are not one issue voters. Most voters have at least 3-5+ issues on their mind they are voting on. For most Jewish voters,see more",

Things are much more calm and less chaotic under Biden.Where are there these riots or protests in the street you are talking about? Charlottesville was supposedly unite the right versus Antifa?

If the US will be fully here on July 19, August 19 and September 19, what really is going on that is making you think it won't be 4 years from now?We both know you live a fairly normal life where nothing all that crazy or unusual is going on. You both got jobs. Probably got a dog. Fridge full of food. Eating out at restaurants. Watching sports and movies.There is nothing theatrical going on, buddy. Now, let's compare our lives to 4 years ago. George Floyd protests. Everyone wearing masks. People dying or hospitalized everywhere due to Covid while Trump couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to shut down or open. Whether he wanted to listen to Fauci or not. And then when he didn't, be too cowardly to fire him despite saying he wanted to. As a leader, you must be decisive. Trump was only concerned with doing what he thought was best for him politically. Not good for the recession as evidenced by a recession. And not good for anyone's health as evidenced by a million deaths in a short period of time, the highest per capita rate of any industrialized country.Look, Biden is the incumbent. Incumbent usually run for reelection and mostly unchallenged within it's party. It is just a fact. With Republicans, they reasonably had other options. 30 percent or so wanted Haley. 45-50 percent of the GOP is with Trump like they are a Branch Davidian. 30 percent are the Haley voter type, some of them will go Trump, some will stay home, some will go Biden, some will go RFK or Stein. The issue for the GOP is that other 20-25 percent. They couldn't unite behind Haley and they were not going to for DeSantis because that vote was being divided.So half the party of those not quite Trump base but conservatives are forced to have less competitive chances to beat Biden because the other half of the GOP worships him no matter what says or does or if he fails miserably. There is no accountability.The only thing the GOP had to do was nominate Haley. You guys are all about believing the polls now because you really like to moderately like what it says. You remember when it had Haley up like +11 to +17 on Biden in some states? The upper midwest (which has the math to determine the election) would not be 50/50ish. It would have been 80-90ish in Haley's favor. She would have taken EVs Trump will not come wuthin 3 points of. Minnesota, Nebraska CD 02, and she would have run close probably even in Virginia and New Hampshire. She may have even made Colorado and New Mexico toss up states in this election cycle.Instead, what there is is a coin flip election like 2016 and 2020. The facts speak for themselves.see more",

The best I can do here is reduce the situation to the core problem we have at hand. Approximately 50% of the country has culturally been left behind and been belittled. They are not happy, they feel cheated by media, by the administrative state, by their schools, by every institution currently run by college graduates indoctrinated into woke Marxism.2024 is the last chance for a political solution. If justice is not served, I'm telling you right now those 50% are opting out.

You are discussing with someone who has their facts straight while is maintaining a tone of respect and cordialness and is acknowledging and appreciating the same of you. No one else is complaining. It is just me and you discussing. If you would prefer a different forum, let me know what your preference is. But this forum is fine. I promise to read what you write as you have taken the time and consideration to do the same for me. What we are discussing is related to the election. For high information readers, they'll probably appreciate as opposed to the common posts of idiotic memes. It's always better to raise complexity than dumb down and cut corners.You stated 50 percent of the country feels this way. Please share your data for why you have reached that conclusion. Once you hit the word woke and Marxism, that's when you hit the rah rah rally around the circle GOP talking points. Only about 1/3 of the US is Democrat. 1/3 is Republican. And 1/3 is Independent or non party affiliated. What you are describing mostly is the Trump base. And that is only roughly about 37-38 percent of the country. Most of which are Republicans and some of which are GOP leaning Independents. There is another 9-10 percent or so that usually typically in a two party race with no competitive 3rd party candidate, will typically vote GOP. This was essentially the mainline Republican that was a never Trumper, where 21 percent voted for Haley in the primary in Indiana as an example even months after she dropped out of the race. They are a huge chunk of that 9-10 percent. And they are a huge chunk of that RFK Jr vote coming from the GOP end.If they preferred Nikki Haley, a member of the former GOP mainstream establishment prior to Trump, who criticized Trump very hard while running against him, how exactly are these voters part of some supposed 50 percent bloc of feeling culturally belittled and left behind?If that's the case, why continuing voting Haley after she dropped out? Is it that they realize that Trump is just a swamp monster like the swamp he couldn't drain out? Now picking from one of the standard bearer career GOP politician career politician before 2016 pool, again? Or, are they just similar to moderate Dems in how they think and operate?So supporting an obese 78 year old with a fragile ego, extremely thin skin, basic decency and family morals, and a record of chaos, mismanagement, incompetence, a lack of a record of following through on more than 80 to 90 percent of his promises, and a record of losing to a guy who campaigned nearly entirely virtually until the end, is the option? The guy who has become so lazy or exhausted he campaigns in non competitive areas like the Bronx and New Jersey? While falling asleep in court on more than one occasion due to exhaustion, not exercising, dealing with the ongoing stress of sentencing and more criminal trials, embarrassing himself saying Nikki Haley was House Speaker instead of Pelosi 7 times, trying to clean that up weeks later using a word to try to explain it that was not anywhere near the definition of anything he was actually explaining, plus calling Ronny Jackson Ronny Johnson multiple times while attempting to insult Biden in real time. What ever zip he had on his fastball is gone. He offers no new ideas and no innovation. He is mostly just concerned with his bruised ego from his criminal conviction, avoiding prosecution in the federal cases and Georgia, and occasionally still crying about the 2020 election.My friend, it will just be more of the same old. If Trump gets elected, Dems will do everything they can to interfere with anything he tries to do. The media will manipulate him so bad his ego won't be able to take it. It will be political gridlock with nothing getting done. Just more investigations. His approval will be low 40s at best. The tariffs he wants to put in place will fall on the shoulders of Americans buying goods and the media will run non stop on it painting the economy as garbage. It will position a Dem president taking over in 2028, following a failed GOP president like Bush leaving on 2008 passing it on to Obama.If Biden wins, what really can those part of that 38 percent, or as you exxageratingly assume about 50 percent, do? You are speaking figuratively. The US will still go on and exist.I think you really overestimate how engaged people actually are. So much of the youth and a good amount of millenials are not politically engaged. They tend to be low information voters who are on IG and Tik Tok too much getting their news from there and Snapchat. They really don't care enough one way or another. It would be a blessing if they cared or had half the concentration you are implying they do, just to even feel like they are being left out. You are probably a bit older. You really may not understand what cell phones have done to their generations. Kids who skated by in school for a decade playing on their phone half the time. Because their parents convinced themselves it was needed for their social status or for emergencies even though if there were an emergency the school Admin or office would call right in to the classroom to get hold of them. Teachers don't try micromanaging these kids behaviors on phones. It's easy in elementary, but they give up in middle and high school. These kids don't know what the words Marxism mean. A lot of them really are barely even aware of what is going on in Hamas. They have already checked out from everything you claim they will check out from and the reason they have checked out is because of how they were raised or not raised. It wasn't about politics, Biden or Trump.You want to know the truth? If Biden wins, they'll be gridlock from the GOP, but it'll be more of the status quo. The question for the undecided voter in a swing state is simple. A vote for RFK is useless. It's true some will stay home. Or leave the president question blank. But for undecided voters choosing Biden or Trump, the choice is between continuing the status quo. Whether they see that as good, bad, a mix or neither. Or, choose the candidate that they associate to a chaotic drama filled past and present. Had the GOP literally picked almost anyone else, the choice would have been easy. Do not be naive. Republicans knew the media could successfully paint this election as about Trump more than Biden. Trump does it to himself. Makes it too easy.see more",
