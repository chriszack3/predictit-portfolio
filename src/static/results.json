If you look at the RCP, 538 or HQ average, if looking at MI, PA and WI, they are all having polling averages that are very close to national average now. This wasn't anywhere near the case with Biden in 2020. It's because these three states have not shifted as right relative to national average as NV, AZ, GA and NC have. It is also because in the upper rustbelt RFK takes more from Trump than Biden, whereas RFK takes more from Biden in the sunbelt and slightly more in other regions in the US.MI and WI now run slightly left to the national average, with or without RFK Jr included. MI is running about even H2H, while running slightly blue with RFK Jr on the ballot. WI is also running even. Or on HQ, +2.4 Biden with RFK. With Pennsylvania, it's +1.0 Trump  with RFK Jr, or +1.7 without him, on HQ.Trump is +0.8 on the polling averages. You'd literally have to use the best case scenario in PA on RCP with RFK included for +3.0, for it to be a +2.2 right awing from the national popular vote average.

He tells the sensible moderate Republicans take the vaccine I helped lead the creation of, while pandering to the other half with conspiracy theories.

You know how that argument gets exposed? Because they can't make up their mind with Fox News. Conservatives love watching their Fox and Friends, or Watters giving Trump a colonoscopy daily with his face, or Gutfeld acting like a buffoon. But, when they start putting out polls that Trump and his base don't like, then it's fake news, right? When they call AZ ahead of everyone else by days and even the election itself as soon as it could even to liberals surprise, than it's fake news again, right?The fake news argument doesn't work with Independents, moderates and undecided voters. It's just a rah rah rally around thing for conservatives to have a partisan talking point on.We have discussed other topics on here and I do know you make a concerted effort to have a conversation with a respectful overtone even when we disagree, which I do appreciate.What I think you really are misunderstanding is a few fundamental realities that is clouding your judgement. You should ask people close to you, but not Jewish, and ideally not sharing your same political partisanship, if you disagree with me.Like it or not, Jewish Americans are a relatively small demographic bloc that is disproportionately populated in very liberal cities and Metropolitan areas. All of New York, New Jersey, Florida (for GOP), Arizona (Biden does not need it to win because MI, WI, PA, MN and NE 02 are running very left of AZ, NV, GA and NC, yet with all those states gets to exactly 270), plus Massachussetts, California and Illinois, are all very blue, we already know will be red, or are purple but not going to construct in how Biden hits 270 in the most winnable path The Jewish population in PA, MI and WI are small. What, like 2-3 percent each? PA even has a Jewish Dem governor with high approval and he is moderate. Even if the overwhelming majority of Jews voted red in your supposed hypothesis, it would not be enough in any of those very blue states to electorally matter. The reality is though the polling doesn't support that any of those states competitive for Republicans. And the data has shown that the Jewish disapproval of Trump is extremely high. And that the Jewish favorability of Trump is low.Do you know how many of these mainstream media companies, and social media companies have Jewish owners or leadership or journalists? If what you are implying is true about Jewish voters going red, why is there no articles or data being published supporting this argument? What would be in it for the media to suppress that article, but not one about possible erosion woth younger, black or Latino voters? For Jewish voters, the rate of having a college education is higher than the average of the US. This contributes to being higher information voters and more complex voters taking a diversity of issues in to consideration when voting. Education rates are higher in the community compared relatively to national average. The political partisanship of most of these individuals historically has been liberal. Jewish people have had to fight that discrimination from conservatives for years for this.Jewish leaders were and have been on the Frontline of the Civil Rights movement. They have been part of the leadership of labor rights movements. Bernie Sanders is iconic to this today and he himself is Jewish. Jewish leaders have disproportionately been part of the Democrat party more than the Republican party. They are now much more educated than the average of the general population, and those with higher education are now currently the bedrock of the moderate Democrats who silently back candidates like Obama, Clinton and Biden, day in and day out.If Jewish voters were breaking towards Trump, where is the data? Talking to your family and friends in your bias political circle is not evidence. Show me the data. You really believe this wouldn't be a story if it were true. It's a story if Muslims in Michigan do a protest primary vote against Biden, its a story if black voters disapprove of Biden in higher numbers in the past, and it's a story if Biden struggled with Latinos. But it is not a story if Jewish voters are breaking towards Trump in these supposed record numbers you are telling us about? Despite there being many Jewish journalist reporters who probably would have a ton of interest in this, especially in NYC, where you obsessed with this the most?So Jewish voters are going to turn their backs on the labor movement, on unions, on Universal health care or ACA pushes, LGBTQ rights, Ukraine (who has a Jewish president, going against Russia who has had a long history of antisemitism), Jewish women will turn their backs on reproductive rights, and so on?  All to join a presidential candidate in Trump who has had a history to pandering to anti Semitic tropes such as saying \"both sides had some fine people\" in Charlottesville? You do realize they were literally on national TV chanting \"Jews will not replace us?\" While holding torches up. You do realize Jewish voters are much higher information voters than the average and they were well aware of this in 2020 when voting heavily for Biden? Anti semitism grew during the Trump Admin. Synongauges ending up with graffiti on the daily. Go ahead and look on Google yourself with the dates from the Trump Admin.I recommend you discussing with those not politically aligned to you, but close to you, if there are any, because you are too close to the issue to think objectively about it. You either are or are closely related to a small number of Jewish voters who have made up their mind about Israel and voting. What you are not realizing is actually simple though. It's that on policy, Biden and Trump are similar on Israel. At least as it pertains to this war. And Biden and Trump have both had their criticism of Netanyahu which is honestly nothing compared to the average Israeli. The logic most Jewish Democrats or Dem leaning Independents apply here is that policy on the conflict in Hamas is not changing even if there is a change in Admin. Most I've spoken have said they'd expect antisemitism to embolden because Trump has been welcoming to white supremacists, such as telling the Proud Boys to stand by and stand back. In a debate of all places.Trump has also spoken well of QAnon which promotes antisemitic conspiracy theories involving Jewish elites, including the Rothchilds and Soros. And Marjorie's space lasers.When Trump called Jewish voters disloyal for heavily voting Democrat, his favorability went down double digits from in the 70s to the 80s in a poll. The polls only count if you like what they say though, otherwise it's fake news, right?Trump called the Israeli Jewish Council brutal killers and he told them they had no other choice to vote for him in 2019. Sounds like the nonsense he spews today. How'd that work out in 2020? About in 10 Jewish voters voting for Biden? Google the Assiciated Press article. It says in 2020, 69 percent voted for Biden. 73 percent said they thought Trump has had too much tolerance for extremist hate groups.High educated voters than the average are higher information voters who go deeper with more complex reasoning and critical thinking. They are not one issue voters. Most voters have at least 3-5+ issues on their mind they are voting on.

You understand there are some battles you may lose but you learn from it to try to do better the next time.In Trump's philosophy, he is not allowed to ever lose. It's either he won or he won. His ego is too thin skinned for politics. He has psychological issues that interfere with his ability to accept you can't control what others think about you. It's like he is permanently in the state of mind of a mentally unstable 14 year old girl who loses it every time someone says something mean about her.When you are a president, a manager, a military general, a teacher, a doctor, or anyone with authority, being criticized by those with less power is part of the game. Trying to micromanage that criticism is what a pu..y wimp does. And it projects weakness which comes off as annoying to Independents.see more","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"3","downvotes":"0"},{"opContent":"Trump is suffering from dementia and the simple fact that he's a CONVICTED FELON FOR LIFE.Cry you piece of chitsee more","opAuthor":"tim","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"0","replies":[[{"opContent":"Mercedes Trump, Ronny Johnson multiple times, Nikki Haley as House Speaker instead of Nancy Pelosi 7 times.

Are you reading 4chan garbage out of the QAnon cesspool of crap? This whole existential theatrical silliness is really getting old. With Trump, he is very norm breaking saying he wants to be a dictator on day one. He is too lazy and incompetent to effectively lead let alone be a dictator. So in all honestly, the US could survive one more term of either of them.Ask yourself this. There were people who said your words 4 years ago. Where are we now? Trump literally said in the debate if Biden won, the stock market would crash. How did that work out in 2021? How is it working out now?On May 19, you probably said the same thing you did just now. Just like you did on April 19. Go ahead and look at your past comments. If the US will be fully here on July 19, August 19 and September 19, what really is going on that is making you think it won't be 4 years from now?We both know you live a fairly normal life where nothing all that crazy or unusual is going on. You both got jobs. Probably got a dog. Fridge full of food. Eating out at restaurants. Watching sports and movies.There is nothing theatrical going on, buddy. Now, let's compare our lives to 4 years ago. George Floyd protests. Everyone wearing masks. People dying or hospitalized everywhere due to Covid while Trump couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to shut down or open. Whether he wanted to listen to Fauci or not. And then when he didn't, be too cowardly to fire him despite saying he wanted to. As a leader, you must be decisive. Trump was only concerned with doing what he thought was best for him politically. Not good for the recession as evidenced by a recession. And not good for anyone's health as evidenced by a million deaths in a short period of time, the highest per capita rate of any industrialized country.Look, Biden is the incumbent. Incumbent usually run for reelection and mostly unchallenged within it's party. It is just a fact. With Republicans, they reasonably had other options. 30 percent or so wanted Haley. 45-50 percent of the GOP is with Trump like they are a Branch Davidian. 30 percent are the Haley voter type, some of them will go Trump, some will stay home, some will go Biden, some will go RFK or Stein. The issue for the GOP is that other 20-25 percent. They couldn't unite behind Haley and they were not going to for DeSantis because that vote was being divided.So half the party of those not quite Trump base but conservatives are forced to have less competitive chances to beat Biden because the other half of the GOP worships him no matter what says or does or if he fails miserably. There is no accountability.The only thing the GOP had to do was nominate Haley. You guys are all about believing the polls now because you really like to moderately like what it says. You remember when it had Haley up like +11 to +17 on Biden in some states? The upper midwest (which has the math to determine the election) would not be 50/50ish. It would have been 80-90ish in Haley's favor. She would have taken EVs Trump will not come wuthin 3 points of. Minnesota, Nebraska CD 02, and she would have run close probably even in Virginia and New Hampshire. She may have even made Colorado and New Mexico toss up states in this election cycle.Instead, what there is is a coin flip election like 2016 and 2020.

They are not happy, they feel cheated by media, by the administrative state, by their schools, by every institution currently run by college graduates indoctrinated into woke Marxism.2024 is the last chance for a political solution. If justice is not served, I'm telling you right now those 50% are opting out.

It is just me and you discussing. If you would prefer a different forum, let me know what your preference is. But this forum is fine. I promise to read what you write as you have taken the time and consideration to do the same for me. What we are discussing is related to the election. For high information readers, they'll probably appreciate as opposed to the common posts of idiotic memes. It's always better to raise complexity than dumb down and cut corners.You stated 50 percent of the country feels this way. Please share your data for why you have reached that conclusion. Once you hit the word woke and Marxism, that's when you hit the rah rah rally around the circle GOP talking points. Only about 1/3 of the US is Democrat. 1/3 is Republican. And 1/3 is Independent or non party affiliated. What you are describing mostly is the Trump base. And that is only roughly about 37-38 percent of the country. Most of which are Republicans and some of which are GOP leaning Independents. There is another 9-10 percent or so that usually typically in a two party race with no competitive 3rd party candidate, will typically vote GOP. This was essentially the mainline Republican that was a never Trumper, where 21 percent voted for Haley in the primary in Indiana as an example even months after she dropped out of the race. They are a huge chunk of that 9-10 percent. And they are a huge chunk of that RFK Jr vote coming from the GOP end.If they preferred Nikki Haley, a member of the former GOP mainstream establishment prior to Trump, who criticized Trump very hard while running against him, how exactly are these voters part of some supposed 50 percent bloc of feeling culturally belittled and left behind?If that's the case, why continuing voting Haley after she dropped out? Is it that they realize that Trump is just a swamp monster like the swamp he couldn't drain out? Now picking from one of the standard bearer career GOP politician career politician before 2016 pool, again? Or, are they just similar to moderate Dems in how they think and operate?So supporting an obese 78 year old with a fragile ego, extremely thin skin, basic decency and family morals, and a record of chaos, mismanagement, incompetence, a lack of a record of following through on more than 80 to 90 percent of his promises, and a record of losing to a guy who campaigned nearly entirely virtually until the end, is the option? The guy who has become so lazy or exhausted he campaigns in non competitive areas like the Bronx and New Jersey? While falling asleep in court on more than one occasion due to exhaustion, not exercising, dealing with the ongoing stress of sentencing and more criminal trials, embarrassing himself saying Nikki Haley was House Speaker instead of Pelosi 7 times, trying to clean that up weeks later using a word to try to explain it that was not anywhere near the definition of anything he was actually explaining, plus calling Ronny Jackson Ronny Johnson multiple times while attempting to insult Biden in real time. What ever zip he had on his fastball is gone. He offers no new ideas and no innovation. He is mostly just concerned with his bruised ego from his criminal conviction, avoiding prosecution in the federal cases and Georgia, and occasionally still crying about the 2020 election.My friend, it will just be more of the same old. If Trump gets elected, Dems will do everything they can to interfere with anything he tries to do. The media will manipulate him so bad his ego won't be able to take it. It will be political gridlock with nothing getting done. Just more investigations. His approval will be low 40s at best. The tariffs he wants to put in place will fall on the shoulders of Americans buying goods and the media will run non stop on it painting the economy as garbage. It will position a Dem president taking over in 2028, following a failed GOP president like Bush leaving on 2008 passing it on to Obama.If Biden wins, what really can those part of that 38 percent, or as you exxageratingly assume about 50 percent, do? You are speaking figuratively. The US will still go on and exist.I think you really overestimate how engaged people actually are. So much of the youth and a good amount of millenials are not politically engaged. They tend to be low information voters who are on IG and Tik Tok too much getting their news from there and Snapchat. They really don't care enough one way or another. It would be a blessing if they cared or had half the concentration you are implying they do, just to even feel like they are being left out. You are probably a bit older. You really may not understand what cell phones have done to their generations. Kids who skated by in school for a decade playing on their phone half the time. Because their parents convinced themselves it was needed for their social status or for emergencies even though if there were an emergency the school Admin or office would call right in to the classroom to get hold of them. Teachers don't try micromanaging these kids behaviors on phones. It's easy in elementary, but they give up in middle and high school. These kids don't know what the words Marxism mean. A lot of them really are barely even aware of what is going on in Hamas. They have already checked out from everything you claim they will check out from and the reason they have checked out is because of how they were raised or not raised. It wasn't about politics, Biden or Trump.You want to know the truth? If Biden wins, they'll be gridlock from the GOP, but it'll be more of the status quo. The question for the undecided voter in a swing state is simple. A vote for RFK is useless. It's true some will stay home. Or leave the president question blank. But for undecided voters choosing Biden or Trump, the choice is between continuing the status quo. Whether they see that as good, bad, a mix or neither. Or, choose the candidate that they associate to a chaotic drama filled past and present. Had the GOP literally picked almost anyone else, the choice would have been easy. Do not be naive. Republicans knew the media could successfully paint this election as about Trump more than Biden. Trump does it to himself.
