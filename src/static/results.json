just like that the media will play everyone like a fiddle.The news cycle will go heavy against Trump on the Supreme Court ruling. Even though it's a mixed ruling that bounces back to the lower courts to get worked out, because it delays pass election day, it's a win for Trump. On the basis of delay much more than legality even if the scope of what charges narrow a little bit.The media will push the narrative of Trump's threat to democracy on this framing. They will for a while. Justifiably so because its a reasonable discussion. What it does de facto is reduce Biden out of the news cycle in MSM. Biden becomes the nominee. Except for the whining of Pirro, Gutfeld and the pro Jim Jones punch drinking catering Trumpster crew after the news of Biden reduces significantly  elsewhere. The July 11 sentencing happens. If he gets sentenced to house arrest or prison, it hurts Trump with Independents. If he doesn't, it enrages those on the democracy arguments in the middle in the realm of something similar to abortion but not to the same extent.And just like that it's back to the coin flip it's always been. That it still is on the 538 election forecast and aggregates across multiple sites in the 3 key rustbelt states that is Joe's path to exactly 270.Not saying this is how it should be necessarily. But this is how it is in American politics. So bet accordingly. And if Trump loses, yes a big if for sure as anything in a (56/57ish to 43/44ish market is on PI at least despite so many trying to pump it higher), this is what the election fraud mumbo jumbo 2.0 will be centered around.And round and round we go.

Romney clobbered Obama in the first debate. Hillary won all the debates against Trump.It is almost like there is precedent that if you don't do well in a debate, you do better in the election. Including for an incumbent.It may be because after having a below average performance, your back is against the wall. The next day Biden gives a fiery speech in North Carolina sounding much closer to the SOTU than the debate. That may be what the Dem party and Dem leaning Independents want to see more. This may have lit a fire under him. Now not taking anything for granted.Meanwhile, with the immunity ruling probably not shielding Trump from prosecution as signaled by his lawyer conceding to the Supreme Court that his alleged crimes are not what immunity protects against, a likely trial is coming by late September that will run through election day. That keeps him off the campaign trail. Merchan also will sentence on July 11. We don't know what that will look like. Whether prison, prison but being out on appeal, house arrest, or otherwise. But its not going to do well with the middle, regardless. They don't like criminality. And the majority of the US by the polling has shown they saw the court as fair and credible.The point I am getting at is there are a lot of fundamentals going both ways in this election. The news cycle moves fast. There has always been a regression to the mean. That mean has been 77,000 in one election determining Trump's 2016 win in 3 states to 43,000 determining Biden's win in 3 states.A vote for Trump on the Biden side has always been a vote against Trump. It was known Biden was old and had gaffe and stuttering back than. A vote for Biden was to make Trump win. Not Biden lose. Biden checked all the boxes of what they thought they needed to beat Trump. They wanted an older white guy to contrast the morals and values of Trump, another old white guy. He checked the box of not being too far left like Bernie. Nowadays, he is continuing to check all those boxes. Not just because he is an incumbent.The evidence is there in that his polling is better than Kamala. It's better than Newsome. Why is it better than Newsome if Newsome is younger and more vibrant?  It's because relative to the Dem party, Biden is not as far left. You can't win over the middle by running too far right. That's how Bill Clinton and Obama won. It is why Biden won in 2020. Hillary's polarizing personality and the fact she didn't campaign much if at all in PA, WI and MI, is a good chunk of why she lost there. It wasn't due to policy.People who are supporting the notion of Biden dropping out now but had those thoughts a couple weeks ago but wouldn't speak up are quite frankly a bit cowardly. It's like saying you can only speak up if it's publicly acceptable too. Than you wind up getting hundreds of journalists literally writing almost the same thing. What is the purpose of their job if they are all writing 98 percent the same opinion?I expect that from journalists. But to say that on PI? That's just lacking originality.A campaign is a complex machine. If Biden were to drop out, the only simple option for Biden would be to endorse Kamala who polls not as well. Would the Dem party support her nomination without trying to press a brokered convention? Maybe. Maybe not. If Biden wouldn't support Kamala as the nominee, then chances are they will not nominate her. They what happens? You get a brokered convention. If a moderate gets picked, like Shapiro or Whitner, then the progressive Bernie AOC wing feels like their voice was shunned. Whereas if Newsome or Bernie were picked, you potentially lose Independents and moderates who may have voted for Biden because of policy. Who otherwise may not vote, may vote 3rd party or may vote Trump.Newsome has tried playing it both ways with moderates and progressives a lot more in the direction of progressives. Granted if you are governor of California, you have to. But with a moderate, you have less to lose because who else are the progressives really going to vote for? They still have anxiety about being blamed for sitting out leading to Trump narrowly winning in 2016. Political campaigns and elections are like a chessboard. If you go mostly by emotion and vibes and not by the data and studying how elections work on past patterns, you lose.It isn't to say replacing Biden isn't an option. It is more about the what comes next and what does the data say. We haven't seen what enough data says yet. But I am guessing by the time that data comes out, the news stories of Trump not being granted immunity from Jan 6 prosecution and then his sentencing on July 11 will take the attention.The person who wins this election is the one who is getting less attention. If more focus is on Trump and the criminality and polarizing rhetoric on abortion, hate mongering migrants and otherwise, he loses. If more of it is on Biden and his shortcomings, Biden loses. The fact is as it pertains to the news cycle, there are a lot more opportunities for that negative spotlight to come on Trump.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"1","postedAtMS":1719668340000,"replies":[{"opContent":"Um...

Listen to what Lichtman has to say on that. He just said it on the episode late Thursday night. You can look at what the consensus of what journalists said back than. Nixon was highly regarded by them. At that point in time, optics mattered less than the substance of what one was saying.With Ford, the dynamics of that race were obviously against him. He overperformed even getting it to be that close. He wasn't even elected as VP. He was appointed in to the position. The GOP was seen as very corrupt as a result. And though Ford wasn't too connected to that, he absorbed the blame. The economy was also not where it needed to be.Regarding your point of Reagen, your point proves that Biden has the capacity for a way to restore himself on the debate stage. His party is still 44 percent even on PI after a poor performance in a debate prior to any regression to the mean, right? We all know Biden has had a history of debating decent at worse to very well. This was one of the rare ones that wasn't. If he didn't give as highly regarded of a SOTU speech a few months earlier, I'd have more doubts. But he did well there so coming back for a better debate in September is more likely. Even if it's only average to decent, it will be a lot to cool anxieties. Additionally, if it weren't for this debate, he would have kept status quo. Now he is realizing he needs to be mote out there. And most thought he did well in NC yesterday.It's not to say it isn't the right choice for him to step down. I just don't see how the data supports it. What comes next?

You probably still think a bunch of idiots standing on the side of a road with signs is an effective way to campaign. You know how you win elections? With innovative ideas. Rallies don't do anything other than raise money. Money that'll be used for his legal fees more than anything else. Why don't rallies do anything? Because those there are already voting for him. No one else feels welcome there with the polarizing hate rhetoric. We are in political gridlock. The best the GOP can try doing is confusing low information voters. Most of them won't even turn out anyway. And doing that just irritates older voters more which is why Biden is running +15 with the elderly compared to them going +2 Trump last time. And that was Fox News saying that. Those elderly voters show up every time in high numbers.

The GOP used to do great with mail in ballots. Now the Dems have built a machine with this and early voting.The group you're describing in the latter honestly isn't thought of to be campaigners. It's usually just people talking to their own family or friends. Most people just think of that as being politically active.Not saying it's right or wrong but when people think campaigning, they think it involves going beyond your own social network. Which again, that takes patience.I'll give you that usually when associating with like minded political people, its hard to get a negative out of that. Still even with this group though, there are individuals who are much more persuasive than others. The ironic thing is many Republicans who like the arrogance of Trump don't like when regular folks are arrogant. And that is how many in the Trump base seem.Remember, a lot of who you are turning out are not quite Trump supporters or 3rd party voters, but folks who definitely won't be Biden. They are really turned off by everything right now. They don't feel like they are being heard when they say Trump now switching his view on a national abortion ban, or issues related to personal conduct and behavior issues with no accountability. How does a Trump supporter have a conversation with this type of GOP or GOP leaning Indy vote? If they are acting arrogant saying Trump can do no wrong, does it help? No. Will it make them less likely to vote? Probably not.

What evidence do you have? The burden of proof in our conversation is on you. There was his account. Her account. Witnesses. Evidence. A trial. He lost.The issue is Trump lies to the point of severely damaged credibility that his word is worth anything. You remember recently when he said he never said to lock Hillary up? The media showed double digit clips later that day consecutively of him literally saying those words.So what you have is her account versus his account but his account has no tangible way of being able to reasonably assume honestly. It's not that she may have not lied, exaggerated, ect. It's that there isn't a particular reason to assume why she as her own character herself is flawed beyond any average person in society. With Trump, he has long standing issues of moral inturpitude, moral deprivation, behaving abusinely publicly, repeatedly lying in an extremely documented manner, ect.You know how everyone here knows your triggered? Because you have to end with attempts at personal insults? The funny thing is those parts of your comments are actually hilarious. Flesh? Lol Be careful with that word, bud.

You made the claim. Not just to me. But everyone. My response was to your claim.If someone says they created a new innovation, people say show me what it is. Is it the responsibility of the customer to prove the engineer or inventor does or doesn't have the invention? What you are asking from me in this situation is counterintuitive.A mature responsible intelligent person responds to my point with a claim and evidence. Instead, you will attempt to throw extremely broad insults to me. It is what a gaslighted such as you does when you have no evidence to defend your claims.Again, you calling him pedo Joe is not mainstream. It is what QAnon, alt right conspiracy theorists try. It doesn't work with convincing undecideds. You guys tried that in 2020. How did it work? All your GOP buddies are focused on Biden's age because the middle will listen to an extent within reason. The pedo mumbo jumbo? Like the election fraud mumbo jumbo? Time to get real, buddy.Unlike Biden, Trump willingly spent time with a known pedophile at the time in Epstein. Billionaires are a small community. Rumors pass around quick. You don't get close to that. Yet Trump did and gave Epstein immense compliments.  I'll give you that Bill Clinton is no better than Trump in this regard. But unlike the both of them, Biden had no association to Epstein.The Kavanaugh situation is not \"kinda\" different. You don't even sound confident if that is the kind of vocabulary you use to describe your ideas. Kavanaugh was going for a Supreme Court seat. It's going for a job. Whereas Trump's case was a civil trial. That is an apples to oranges comparison. And the difference is Trump lost his civil trial and was found liable. With Kavanaugh, there were some inconsistencies. With Carroll, there wasn't. Period. You heard that? Period.

Even with Aileen Cannon who has repeatedly caused delays and the conservative Supreme Court justices have green lighted his immunity nonsense that even his lawyer conceded that won't apply to his alleged crimes.Ask yourself, are there legitimate things immunity for a president should cover? Yes. If it's within the scope and purview of your duties. Why didn't conservative judges in the appeal courts go with Trump on that? You don't think the conservative justices know that there would not be a legal basis to not provide him full immunity? If not, why ask? Instead, what they have done is pull tactics to buy him time pushing the verdict of an election past election day.How do we know if that was going through the minds of Alito, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and the others? We don't. But do you at least believe they are intelligent to know the optics of how that would look? The answer is of course they know that but as judges they have to do their job. But could there be an element of bias that pushed them in that direction? We will never know.What is the limit though? The limit is that they will not go out of bounds so far they can't come back enough to maintain some integrity in the court. Though Alito and Thomas are hurting that more in their personal lives. Thomas clearly doesn't care and just keeps doing what he wants. But it does seem to be rattling Alito a bit to keep him out for days around the same time for unannounced reasons.The same thought process can be applied by conservatives to Bragg. With Willis, the crimes mirror what Jack Smith is prosecuting for so that wouldn't be much of an argument. But with Bragg, conservatives could try saying look at how Dem NYC is. It's not that the crime wasn't a crime. Everyone knows that. It is a measurement of odds of if you can win a case or not. Does understanding how politicized society is may be part of that? Perhaps. But if it weren't Bragg in his spot, would have another DA there did it? Very likely. Would have they been as skilled as Bragg? Maybe, maybe not.The reality is it is more about Trump supporters ending up on a jury causing a hung jury that prosecutors would have to consider.If they end up with 3 Trump supporting jurors in Georgia or Florida, it's the Trump supporters that will cause a hung jury. Not an acquitted. In NY and DC, lkle everywhere, there are jurors who aren't politically engaged. Who are Independent. Trump willingly committed the crimes. He didn't think it was prosecutable. His lawyers thought it would never come to fruition. They thought at worse civil penalties. They were wrong.Yet the NY Post is running articles talking about how Dem voters in the other 4 boroughs are talking like Staten Islsnd Republicans now? But than when Trump loses his trial, nope, NYC must be ice blue, right? Can't have it both ways at the same time without those in the middle knowing they are full of sh*t.Arguing political bias on Alvin Bragg may go further with Independents. The GOP knows no one really cares about Bragg though. It's Biden who is running. So they say a president directed Bragg to inducted? With no evidence. This is why only 43 percent believe that when polled, whereas 50 percent said that's not true.How does what goes around come around here? Give me actual prospective examples. If the GOP had what they wanted on Biden, they would have impeached him. So assuming they win, how will this work? Pick an AG who tries to indict him for bogus nonsense? It wouldn't get pass a grand jury. And where would this grand jury be? Ice blue DC? Even if it weren't, it wouldn't.

It would help to know who is your currently preferred candidate and who you voted for in 2020 and 2016. If the answer is and was Trump in a general election (not the primary), then there is obviously a partisan bias to how you are interpreting information. Which of course is your right. But the point is it contextualizes the lens through which you are observing things.The same MAGA still re-vote those GOP senators in each and every cycle. Graham, Grassley, McConnell, you name it. The old establishment is still very much alive in the GOP. If Trump could get those who voted against him on impeachment and removal to retire or not seek reelection, why wouldn't he encourage his base to do the same for that old establishment that still dominates Congress. That still if they had it their way would be the biggest war hawks. Why is it acceptable to say he will drain the swamp and than not even fight to try draining it throughout his 1st term? Including career GOP establishment politicians for most of his cabinet positions. Barr, Pence, Haley, you name it. Having career political slime like Bannon and Stone involved in his campaigns. This to me reads like a hypocrite. Someone who isn't a man of his word. A showman who wants you to believe one thing, than he does another. Because his base either doesn't care enough to call him out on it, they aren't informed enough to call him out on it because they rely on misinformation from far right wing sources, or they are too intimidated to call Trump out on his contradictions and nonsense. Not because of Trump himself but rather because of the ridicule and exclusion from their MAGA peers for being disloyal.Regarding your second paragraph, though you admit Trump was a terrible president, you are still sanitizing a bit. Even before COVID there were economic indicators all over the place of an converted curve. Farmers in the Midwest were relying on socialist type of aid packages racking up the national debt because of how much they were absorbing the costs of the tariffs. China wasn't paying for those. The American consumer was. It wasn't to say that Trump wasn't fighting on trade wasn't the right move. The issue is he didn't do it effectively. At best, prior to COVID, it was a relatively average economy. He inherited a good economy from Obama.There is this is this thought that if it weren't for COVID and the recession that came with it (and social unrest riots in the summer he showed no moral leadership too, which in some ways was a spill over from the public angst in general)  that he would have won. That is not what the data was suggesting at all. He dismissed the polls as fake. Granted they were off on him a little bit but not enough to win. What the data suggested was Biden had a key advantage in the popular vote but because PA, MI and WI was running right to the country by 3-4 percent at the time, that he would need at least 4 percent or more to get in to a zone where securing 270 EVs. Hence meaning it was always known to be a toss up. COVID didn't change that. It's measure for the most part, like 95 percent+, those Hillary voters became Biden voters. Plus increased turnout. The former Johnson and Stein were lopsidedly former Obama voters who than broke towards Biden. Even if Trump did well with managing COVID which he obviously didn't, he wasn't going to gain that suburban women and college educated voters who already couldn't stand him.  Women especially broke hard against him on abortion. They showed it in 2018.And they weren't forgetting. And they still aren't.  Look at early Jan '21 senste elections. Look at the midterms. Look at all the off cycle elections. The Dems have consistently been outperforming the polls ever since the '20 presidential election. What is your theory for why that is? Many of those elections have occurred since the pandemic ended.With Bush on foreign policy, it is a pretty low bar for anyone to be compared to. Generally speaking though, Trump has made our presence around the word less seriously taken. He's been extremely soft on Russia saying Putin should just go ahead and invade. It is disturbing why Putin has had so much control over the decision he makes regarding foreign policy towards Biden. What does he gain by going soft on Russia? Do they have dirt on Trump? What is it it for America to be soft on Russia? Or threatening to leave NATO? It does not support the geopolitical interests of the US. We haven't received anything in exchange for that. There is clear incentive on foreign policy for Russia to have Trump as president over anyone else. Not just a Dem but other GOP too. You think Haley would allow any of that crap? No.Trump has wandered to dictators. Other countries around the world really aren't that stupid. They know what America is and what it stands for. And they know Trump is outside the norm of what the values are of this country.The funny thing though is foreign policy isn't even why he got elected or lost in 2020. And it probably won't be a major factor in whether he wins or loses this time around. The domestic issues are what voters are most concerned about.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","postedAtMS":1719597720000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"Regarding your

reply to your last paragraph to start out, I am going by actions. Not words. With Trump, he has sided with Kim Jung Un over Otto Warmbier's family. He wouldn't stand up to him. If he thought he didn't want to insult Kim Jung Un for the purposes of getting them to denuclearize, it didn't work. But to not side with a tortured American citizen in that situation is not acceptable. Likewise, embarrassing the US siding with Putin over your own CIA and Intel community in Helsinki was one of the most shameful foreign relations moments on US history. Context was provided when I made my statement. You chose to ignore it.Where I respect a point you make is saying both Trump and Bush both not caring about this country. You are soft on Trump in general. But in that statement, you were practical and realistic. If we are comparing Bush to Trump, it is a very low bar. Do I think Bush was all out for big business interests over any love he may have had for this country? Absolutely. But that's who the GOP wanted back than. They could have voted John Kerry. The news of WMDs was out before the '04 election. I get Kerry was a flip flopper. But at least there was a chance to have ended the war? As opposed to what? The GOP still voted almost 46 percent for McCain. He literally said once we could have been Iraq for 100 years. Trump became president only 8 years after that point. Yet 8 years earlier most Trump supporters voted McCain. Even though Obama was the one who ended the Iraq War as he said he was going to. It's true that Obama cut in to acquiring more moderate Republicans than anyone in this century. But the overwhelming majority of Republicans still voted for McCain. And than Bush. Why? Because everything is a binary choice. And there is always a false equivalency. What determines party lines in this country mostly comes down to policy. There are much less undecided voters today. Maybe 5-6 percent at most in each of the swing states. Even the RFK Jr voted he gets in polls right now break down the middle on party lines to the GOP and Dems when it becomes a binary choice, if they vote.The issue for you guys is you wanted that in Bush and Cheney. And than at some point you didn't. It was Bush that chose to invade Iraq. Not Clinton and Obama. Bush was the president at the time he led this mission. The GOP of today who were alive back than were mostly GOP voters back than. They just don't feel they have to assign any accountability to themselves. You should have seen the bystanders who went along with Nazism in Europe decades later. The ones who weren't quite directly involved in the worse of it who got away with it. Convenient how their values change in a way where they on their own terms got to determine what that would be. Rather than being held accountable. That is just like today's GOP in the south being mostly the Dems of the south. In many cases, the parents, grandparents, ect. Funny how they like to pretend it was just a coincidence the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights legislation just correlated with the timing of that switch to becoming GOP.Decades past and no accountability on them. We are talking about elderly white folks all over the south today who when they were in their 20s could have been participating in hangings, or watching from crowds, in states like Mississippi. South Carolina and so on, all because a black kid whistled at a white woman, because they tried to vote, desecrate schools, ect. These evil people were of course a century earlier either slave owners, or often just others who were too poor to own enslaved people, while doing even worse racist bidding for the wealthy slave owners, in their rhetoric. You can literally draw a line from the mid 1800s to today and see a pattern of how many folks trace roots to the worse pf that hate to now being the type of folks who freaked out on same srx marriage 10 years ago who now freak out on transgenders today who now go on sites like Breibart and News Max for anti immigrant and racist rhetoric. The types who get sucked in to that QAnon bubble.I'll respond to your other points in a later comment.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","postedAtMS":1719595860000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"To reply to your last paragraph to start out, I am going by

appreciate you acknowledging that Biden won in 2020. Many of your GOP or GOP Independents friends to this day friends refuse to.You have already made up your mind on this election though. You are saying the American people do not have the right to make a choice. How is this promoting Democracy? Even before Trump was convicted, all of PA, WI and MI, were swing states.Do you realize that when you lose a presidential election, your odds of winning the next election usually are presumably not going to be competitive? The reason he is competitive is because of Biden's low approval, not because Trump's term was regarded successfully. Because it obviously was not. Trump's favorability is very low too.

An election is complex with many moving parts.That doesn't mean an election is stolen, buddy. That is not how moderates and Independents see it. The odds of Trump winning the appeal are very low. Look at the percent of cases that are overturned in NY State. It's very low.Was the election stolen from Hillary because Trump willfully concealed the information from the public of an affair with Stormy prior to the 2016 election? Even if you don't think it is a crime, it is a fact that if the public had that information in a close election, it may have been enough for Hillary to win 77,000 more votes in MI, WI and PA. By the same standard you are applying here, Hillary had the election stolen from her.Was the fact it was announced 9 days before the election by the DOJ they were reopening the investigation in to Hillary interference in a manner stealing the election from her? Despite DOJ policy being not to do so 60 days within an election? That's all perspective but based on your framing of other issues, you would look like a hypocrite.If it is determined by the Supreme Court that Trump is not to receive any immunity related to alleged crimes pertaining to January 6th or classified documents, did the Supreme Court or Aileen Cannon interfere in the election to delay it out so far that the trial and/or result couldn't come out till after the election? Is that election interference? Dems may think so. Yet, if the timing of such makes it so Trump can't campaign because he's in Chutkan's court in September, October and early November, then Trump will cry about that too?You know what is true though? The Republican led Senate committee formally determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to the benefit of Trump. Though they said Trump wasn't involved himself. Though tons of indictments came out of his Admin. Look at how virtually none have come out of Obama and Biden though. Trump surrounds himself with corrupt pieces of garbage. His inexperience politically made him rely on people any seasoned politician would have wanted nothing to do with. Talking about not draining the swamp. He injected swamp monster trash in to it.You know what the real truth is? There are elections. People vote in elections based on their views and information. You will not be able to control all the information that is out there. If you win, you are known as a winner. If you lose, you are known as a loser. Biden won. Trump lost. It's that simple.Trump was convicted by 12 jurors. Trump chose to commit crimes in the extremely Democratic land of Manhattan. It was a really stupid choice. That has nothing to do with Biden. Biden has no authority over the state of NY. Even his own AG operates separate of him but at least he has federal pardon authority. He doesn't in NY. GA has a GOP governor and secretary of state. They even got reelected since the last presidential election. Is that interference too?Be a man, accept you may win or lose. It's life.

degrees court temperatures like he is in the tundra, accidentally calling his wife Mercedes, saying Joan Rivers voted from him when she died before he became a political candidate, and repeatedly falling asleep in court.Biden has actually had quite a bit of accomplishments. I'll give you that some of them are partisan in nature, but some aren't. At least he actually gets things done.What exactly did Trump get done on any of his promises? Like 90 percent on nothing.Did Obamacare get repealed and replaced? No. Did it get repealed? No. Did he offer what that replacement was? No. Did he have 53 GOP senators and a GOP house at the time? Yes.On the other side, meanwhile, Biden gets McConnell on board with infrastructure in a bipartisan way.Did Trump get an infrastructure deal done despite having a GOP led House and Senate for 2 years? Despite promising? No.Did Trump get an immigration deal done? Despite promising? No.Did Trump get North Korea to denuclearize? No. Did he make America look weak by saying Kim Jung Un had a beautiful vision for his country after Otto Warmbier was returned to us basically beaten to death? Yes.Trump said he would be tough on Russia. In Helsinki, he severely embarrassed our country by siding with Putin over the CIA and all intel organizations which he directly had authority over. Made us as much of a laughing stock only to get laughed at by the whole world when Trump was at the UN himself.Trump told us we would have a border wall with Mexico. He says there was a border wall, yet there are now tons of undocumented folks coming across the border? Are they going through an imaginary wall?On the last day of Trump's presidency, CBP on their site, another government agency under Trump's hand pick DHS secretary authority, said only 52 miles of new wall had been built. And only about 400 miles of new replacement fencing was installed. Only less than a quarter of the border.Trump said that he would eliminate the national debt in two terms. Instead, he created as much debt proportionately in one term as Obama in two terms.Trump promised a new Iran deal would be created. Never happened.Almost every promise he made never came true. Promises made, promises not kept.What did he accomplish beyond 3 supreme court justices, starting prison reform which was a Democrat interest, and making you feel warm and fuzzy inside?

I have since 2010. I am in mid-30s. When I live in NJ in '08 and voted Obama, that vote was not changing much. In 2012, in Florida when I voted Obama, one could argue that my vote actually did matter given how close it was. In 2016, I voted Hillary.I didn't like her much but Trump came off as an incompetent businessman given the 6 bankruptciee. His incompetent way of doing business and managing crisis came true during COVID, plus the massive racial unrest following Floyd's death, and his mismanagement of COVID spilled over in to a massive recession. He said he would be the greatest jobs president ever. Yet he ended with 6.3 percent unemployment following starting on day one with 5.0 percent the second he took over from Obama.Trump like every other politician like to the American people with unrealistic goals. Not even scratching the surface. Saying the national debt would be wiped out in 8 years under him. Meanwhile, he was nearly identically on pace as Obama in accruing more debt. That's what a showman does. They bullsh*t you because they are full of sh*t. He became like every other politician except worse because he is lazy. If you too lazy to read a briefing, you too lazy to run a country. Lied to us too saying he would surround himself with the best only layer on to whine about his secretary of state, UN Ambassador, attorney General and even his VP.Understand this, a vote for Biden is more a vote against Trump than a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden. It is how I see it and it was how moderates, Independents and undecided voters saw it in 2020. I am an Independent and there are issues I am to the left (i.e. labor union rights, health care, LGBTQ rights, supporting Ukraine against Russia in their war), some issues I am in the middle on (i.e. immigration, policy on Gaza and Palestine, policy related to reproductive rights, policy related to climate change, and 2nd amendment rights) and to the right on (i.e. seeing some of the pros of drilling state side, preferring to buy products made in the US, supporting police though I see that as intertwined with supporting unions). On some of rhe moderate issues, I lean more center ledt. On other issues, I am more center right.But for me, it's always been a given that Trump has had severe issues of moral deprivation and poor character. The bigger issue is the dude just couldn't bring the bacon home.At this point, voting Republican period would be very hard. It's not just about Trump anymore. I see there fundamentally being something wrong with people who are selectively silent with zero willingness to speak out when their leader is in the wrong morally, ethically or is simply sucking in their performance. I would have always heard Romney, McCain and Bush, and their supporters out. I don't like a lot of what the Dem party does at times. But it's become evident which party promotes thinking and freedom of thought and expression. And which one expects compliance and shutting your mouth when it's politically inconvenient no matter how unethical.

Same if the 538 Forecast moves. Right now the 538 Forecast is 50 out of 100 for both Biden and Trump. On RCP, Trump is +0.6 in the H2H and +0.9 in the 5 way. 538 doesn't do a national polling average for H2H. At least not that I have seen. They only included RFK Jr.Nationally, RFK Jr and Biden are splitting. A couple days ago, in the Fox News poll where they asked RFK Jr voted who they would vote for between, 47 percent said Trump, 47 percent said Biden. The difference is RFK Jr pulls more from Biden than Trump in Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. Whereas, RFK Jr pulls more from Trump than Biden in Wisconsin and Michigan, and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania and Arizona.Generally speaking, the more white and more college educated share of a Democratic polling share is, he is less supported by Dems, relative to the GOP. His support comes more from low information voters. Luckily for Biden, the Dem voting share is whiter and more college educated in PA, MI, WI, NE CD 02, MN and AZ. Because all of those minus AZ equal exactly 270 EVs. And Arizona though going Trump right now is closer than all of the others, and has 11 EVs, as a back up to WI (10 EVs, which was the tipping state in both '16 and '20).For Biden, I would say the bigger issue is that somewhat with Stein but even more with Cornel West, those voters if they were to vote in the 2 way, would be more likely to go Biden. The two of them probably will combined not get more than the same 1.7-1.8 percent 3rd party candidates received in all elections between 2000 to 2020, excluding 2016. Whereas with RFK Jr, it's more unique to see a 3rd party candidate pulling equally from both a Dem and GOP presidential candidate.If Stein and C. West for example together take 1.1 out of that 1.8 that would have gone to Biden and only 0.5 from Trump, that 0.6 percent could be very important in the upper Midwest. Especially in states where C. West has tried appealing to Muslim voters with pro Palestine rhetoric, like Michigan and to a lesser extent Minnesota.As that relates to your question, without having the 5 way poll, it means the polling averages both nationally and state level, will slant a little more towards Biden than Trump. Whereas Biden is +0.1 in the 3 way 538 national average, Trump is +0.9 in the 5 way. That is a gap of 1.0 percent.However, that theory may be wrong too, because with HQ in their 3 way without Stein and West, it's +0.9 Trump as well.With Wisconsin and Michigan, it's all running at or less than 1 percent, or even less than a half percent, whether H2H, 3 way or 5 way, on multiple of RCP, HQ and 538. There isn't enough polling data coming out of Minnesota or Nebraska CD 02, but it's usually so that it runs more blue than MI WI PA. With more polling come out of there, it may give Biden a slight boost in gambling markets by a cent or two.Between RCP, 538 and HQ, whether 2 way, 3 way or 5 way, Pennsylvania is ranging from +1.3 to +2.9 Trump. The  +2.9 outlier is the 5 way RCP. Everything else between all of HQ, 538 and RCP, doesn't go above +2.0 for Trump.When you see Pennsylvania's polling averages move to where Wisconsin and Michigan, which is likely to occur after Biden holds his own or better in the debate like he always has and after Trump's sentencing, you'll start to see this move. On Polymarkets, PA has been slightly leading Biden for a while now.In both '16 and '20, PA was not the tipping state. It was Pennsylvania predicted by experts both times with Wisconsin as the other possibility. And lots of people both times predicted it would be PA. Turned out being WI as tpping state.  With a more popular Dem governor than last time, along with PA having elected a Dem senator since, I don't see PA being more to the right than WI, or WI being more to the left. At best, even.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"10","downvotes":"0","postedAtMS":1718975880000,"replies":[{"opContent":"Nice post.

The issue with RCP is they have included right wing bias garbage companies that get D or F ratings like Traflagar.It is a close election. Just like 2016 and 2020. People mostly will be voting the same way they did last time and the time before that. It is hyoerpartisan times. Whether Biden is +2, Trump is +1, or they are even, in nationally polling, is generally not important. What is important is what the polling averages say in MI, WI and PA. Probably MN too but it seems very unrealistic for Trump to win NE 02 or MN without taking at least one or more of MI, WI and PA. This is where the math to get to 270 is. AZ is a back up plan to if Biden slightly loses WI. GA is the back up to MI. GA + NV would be the back up to PA. It's less reliable pathways in either case. They shouod keep canpaigning heavily there along with FL and NC to get the GOP to waste resources playing defense.Even RCP has Biden even with Trump in MI now and slightly leading with RFK, Stein and West included.

Which seems to do nothing with the middle.Trump practically is a socialist. When his trade war woth China was skyrocketing the cost on agricultural goods and metals bankrupting by farmers in ruby red Midwestern states by the drove, he went full Lenin on giving a huge socialist type package to farmers. Talk about a socialist inflationist.Trump was in practice as big a spender as a socialist. The national debt grew in greater proportion by Trump in one term relative to Obama's two terms. Trump said he would eliminate the national debt in 8 years. He had the same build up of national debt or worse relative to Obama. And you wonder how that, a recession, racial unrest he could not manage and a million Covid deaths in about 9 months (the highest per capita of any industrialized country) led to him ending as a one term loser with an approval average never getting out of the 40s at any point during his presidency and staying low 40s for most of it?The dude spends out of his you know what.

Trump won the elderly vote 50-48 in 2020. So if Biden is running a +15 with them, that's a good sign for him.

is not fake news just because you do not like it. You know how that argument gets exposed? Because they can't make up their mind with Fox News. Conservatives love watching their Fox and Friends, or Watters giving Trump a colonoscopy daily with his face, or Gutfeld acting like a buffoon. But, when they start putting out polls that Trump and his base don't like, then it's fake news, right? When they call AZ ahead of everyone else by days and even the election itself as soon as it could even to liberals surprise, than it's fake news again, right?The fake news argument doesn't work with Independents, moderates and undecided voters. It's just a rah rah rally around thing for conservatives to have a partisan talking point on.We have discussed other topics on here and I do know you make a concerted effort to have a conversation with a respectful overtone even when we disagree, which I do appreciate.What I think you really are misunderstanding is a few fundamental realities that is clouding your judgement. You should ask people close to you, but not Jewish, and ideally not sharing your same political partisanship, if you disagree with me.Like it or not, Jewish Americans are a relatively small demographic bloc that is disproportionately populated in very liberal cities and Metropolitan areas. All of New York, New Jersey, Florida (for GOP), Arizona (Biden does not need it to win because MI, WI, PA, MN and NE 02 are running very left of AZ, NV, GA and NC, yet with all those states gets to exactly 270), plus Massachussetts, California and Illinois, are all very blue, we already know will be red, or are purple but not going to construct in how Biden hits 270 in the most winnable path The Jewish population in PA, MI and WI are small. What, like 2-3 percent each? PA even has a Jewish Dem governor with high approval and he is moderate. Even if the overwhelming majority of Jews voted red in your supposed hypothesis, it would not be enough in any of those very blue states to electorally matter. The reality is though the polling doesn't support that any of those states competitive for Republicans. And the data has shown that the Jewish disapproval of Trump is extremely high. And that the Jewish favorability of Trump is low.Do you know how many of these mainstream media companies, and social media companies have Jewish owners or leadership or journalists? If what you are implying is true about Jewish voters going red, why is there no articles or data being published supporting this argument? What would be in it for the media to suppress that article, but not one about possible erosion woth younger, black or Latino voters? For Jewish voters, the rate of having a college education is higher than the average of the US. This contributes to being higher information voters and more complex voters taking a diversity of issues in to consideration when voting. Education rates are higher in the community compared relatively to national average. The political partisanship of most of these individuals historically has been liberal. Jewish people have had to fight that discrimination from conservatives for years for this.Jewish leaders were and have been on the Frontline of the Civil Rights movement. They have been part of the leadership of labor rights movements. Bernie Sanders is iconic to this today and he himself is Jewish. Jewish leaders have disproportionately been part of the Democrat party more than the Republican party. They are now much more educated than the average of the general population, and those with higher education are now currently the bedrock of the moderate Democrats who silently back candidates like Obama, Clinton and Biden, day in and day out.If Jewish voters were breaking towards Trump, where is the data? Talking to your family and friends in your bias political circle is not evidence. Show me the data. You really believe this wouldn't be a story if it were true. It's a story if Muslims in Michigan do a protest primary vote against Biden, its a story if black voters disapprove of Biden in higher numbers in the past, and it's a story if Biden struggled with Latinos. But it is not a story if Jewish voters are breaking towards Trump in these supposed record numbers you are telling us about? Despite there being many Jewish journalist reporters who probably would have a ton of interest in this, especially in NYC, where you obsessed with this the most?So Jewish voters are going to turn their backs on the labor movement, on unions, on Universal health care or ACA pushes, LGBTQ rights, Ukraine (who has a Jewish president, going against Russia who has had a long history of antisemitism), Jewish women will turn their backs on reproductive rights, and so on?  All to join a presidential candidate in Trump who has had a history to pandering to anti Semitic tropes such as saying \"both sides had some fine people\" in Charlottesville? You do realize they were literally on national TV chanting \"Jews will not replace us?\" While holding torches up. You do realize Jewish voters are much higher information voters than the average and they were well aware of this in 2020 when voting heavily for Biden? Anti semitism grew during the Trump Admin. Synongauges ending up with graffiti on the daily. Go ahead and look on Google yourself with the dates from the Trump Admin.I recommend you discussing with those not politically aligned to you, but close to you, if there are any, because you are too close to the issue to think objectively about it. You either are or are closely related to a small number of Jewish voters who have made up their mind about Israel and voting. What you are not realizing is actually simple though. It's that on policy, Biden and Trump are similar on Israel. At least as it pertains to this war. And Biden and Trump have both had their criticism of Netanyahu which is honestly nothing compared to the average Israeli. The logic most Jewish Democrats or Dem leaning Independents apply here is that policy on the conflict in Hamas is not changing even if there is a change in Admin. Most I've spoken have said they'd expect antisemitism to embolden because Trump has been welcoming to white supremacists, such as telling the Proud Boys to stand by and stand back. In a debate of all places.Trump has also spoken well of QAnon which promotes antisemitic conspiracy theories involving Jewish elites, including the Rothchilds and Soros. And Marjorie's space lasers.When Trump called Jewish voters disloyal for heavily voting Democrat, his favorability went down double digits from in the 70s to the 80s in a poll. The polls only count if you like what they say though, otherwise it's fake news, right?Trump called the Israeli Jewish Council brutal killers and he told them they had no other choice to vote for him in 2019. Sounds like the nonsense he spews today. How'd that work out in 2020? About in 10 Jewish voters voting for Biden? Google the Assiciated Press article. It says in 2020, 69 percent voted for Biden. 73 percent said they thought Trump has had too much tolerance for extremist hate groups.High educated voters than the average are higher information voters who go deeper with more complex reasoning and critical thinking.

Are you reading 4chan garbage out of the QAnon cesspool of crap? This whole existential theatrical silliness is really getting old. With Trump, he is very norm breaking saying he wants to be a dictator on day one. He is too lazy and incompetent to effectively lead let alone be a dictator. So in all honestly, the US could survive one more term of either of them.Ask yourself this. There were people who said your words 4 years ago. Where are we now? Trump literally said in the debate if Biden won, the stock market would crash. How did that work out in 2021? How is it working out now?On May 19, you probably said the same thing you did just now. Just like you did on April 19. Go ahead and look at your past comments. If the US will be fully here on July 19, August 19 and September 19, what really is going on that is making you think it won't be 4 years from now?We both know you live a fairly normal life where nothing all that crazy or unusual is going on. You both got jobs. Probably got a dog. Fridge full of food. Eating out at restaurants. Watching sports and movies.There is nothing theatrical going on, buddy. Now, let's compare our lives to 4 years ago. George Floyd protests. Everyone wearing masks. People dying or hospitalized everywhere due to Covid while Trump couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to shut down or open. Whether he wanted to listen to Fauci or not. And then when he didn't, be too cowardly to fire him despite saying he wanted to. As a leader, you must be decisive. Trump was only concerned with doing what he thought was best for him politically. Not good for the recession as evidenced by a recession. And not good for anyone's health as evidenced by a million deaths in a short period of time, the highest per capita rate of any industrialized country.Look, Biden is the incumbent. Incumbent usually run for reelection and mostly unchallenged within it's party. It is just a fact. With Republicans, they reasonably had other options. 30 percent or so wanted Haley. 45-50 percent of the GOP is with Trump like they are a Branch Davidian. 30 percent are the Haley voter type, some of them will go Trump, some will stay home, some will go Biden, some will go RFK or Stein. The issue for the GOP is that other 20-25 percent. They couldn't unite behind Haley and they were not going to for DeSantis because that vote was being divided.So half the party of those not quite Trump base but conservatives are forced to have less competitive chances to beat Biden because the other half of the GOP worships him no matter what says or does or if he fails miserably. There is no accountability.The only thing the GOP had to do was nominate Haley. You guys are all about believing the polls now because you really like to moderately like what it says. You remember when it had Haley up like +11 to +17 on Biden in some states? The upper midwest (which has the math to determine the election) would not be 50/50ish. It would have been 80-90ish in Haley's favor. She would have taken EVs Trump will not come wuthin 3 points of. Minnesota, Nebraska CD 02, and she would have run close probably even in Virginia and New Hampshire. She may have even made Colorado and New Mexico toss up states in this election cycle.Instead, what there is is a coin flip election like 2016 and 2020.

I promise to read what you write as you have taken the time and consideration to do the same for me. What we are discussing is related to the election. For high information readers, they'll probably appreciate as opposed to the common posts of idiotic memes. It's always better to raise complexity than dumb down and cut corners.You stated 50 percent of the country feels this way. Please share your data for why you have reached that conclusion. Once you hit the word woke and Marxism, that's when you hit the rah rah rally around the circle GOP talking points. Only about 1/3 of the US is Democrat. 1/3 is Republican. And 1/3 is Independent or non party affiliated. What you are describing mostly is the Trump base. And that is only roughly about 37-38 percent of the country. Most of which are Republicans and some of which are GOP leaning Independents. There is another 9-10 percent or so that usually typically in a two party race with no competitive 3rd party candidate, will typically vote GOP. This was essentially the mainline Republican that was a never Trumper, where 21 percent voted for Haley in the primary in Indiana as an example even months after she dropped out of the race. They are a huge chunk of that 9-10 percent. And they are a huge chunk of that RFK Jr vote coming from the GOP end.If they preferred Nikki Haley, a member of the former GOP mainstream establishment prior to Trump, who criticized Trump very hard while running against him, how exactly are these voters part of some supposed 50 percent bloc of feeling culturally belittled and left behind?If that's the case, why continuing voting Haley after she dropped out? Is it that they realize that Trump is just a swamp monster like the swamp he couldn't drain out? Now picking from one of the standard bearer career GOP politician career politician before 2016 pool, again? Or, are they just similar to moderate Dems in how they think and operate?So supporting an obese 78 year old with a fragile ego, extremely thin skin, basic decency and family morals, and a record of chaos, mismanagement, incompetence, a lack of a record of following through on more than 80 to 90 percent of his promises, and a record of losing to a guy who campaigned nearly entirely virtually until the end, is the option? The guy who has become so lazy or exhausted he campaigns in non competitive areas like the Bronx and New Jersey? While falling asleep in court on more than one occasion due to exhaustion, not exercising, dealing with the ongoing stress of sentencing and more criminal trials, embarrassing himself saying Nikki Haley was House Speaker instead of Pelosi 7 times, trying to clean that up weeks later using a word to try to explain it that was not anywhere near the definition of anything he was actually explaining, plus calling Ronny Jackson Ronny Johnson multiple times while attempting to insult Biden in real time. What ever zip he had on his fastball is gone. He offers no new ideas and no innovation. He is mostly just concerned with his bruised ego from his criminal conviction, avoiding prosecution in the federal cases and Georgia, and occasionally still crying about the 2020 election.My friend, it will just be more of the same old. If Trump gets elected, Dems will do everything they can to interfere with anything he tries to do. The media will manipulate him so bad his ego won't be able to take it. It will be political gridlock with nothing getting done. Just more investigations. His approval will be low 40s at best. The tariffs he wants to put in place will fall on the shoulders of Americans buying goods and the media will run non stop on it painting the economy as garbage. It will position a Dem president taking over in 2028, following a failed GOP president like Bush leaving on 2008 passing it on to Obama.If Biden wins, what really can those part of that 38 percent, or as you exxageratingly assume about 50 percent, do? You are speaking figuratively. The US will still go on and exist.I think you really overestimate how engaged people actually are. So much of the youth and a good amount of millenials are not politically engaged. They tend to be low information voters who are on IG and Tik Tok too much getting their news from there and Snapchat. They really don't care enough one way or another. It would be a blessing if they cared or had half the concentration you are implying they do, just to even feel like they are being left out. You are probably a bit older. You really may not understand what cell phones have done to their generations. Kids who skated by in school for a decade playing on their phone half the time. Because their parents convinced themselves it was needed for their social status or for emergencies even though if there were an emergency the school Admin or office would call right in to the classroom to get hold of them. Teachers don't try micromanaging these kids behaviors on phones. It's easy in elementary, but they give up in middle and high school. These kids don't know what the words Marxism mean. A lot of them really are barely even aware of what is going on in Hamas. They have already checked out from everything you claim they will check out from and the reason they have checked out is because of how they were raised or not raised. It wasn't about politics, Biden or Trump.You want to know the truth? If Biden wins, they'll be gridlock from the GOP, but it'll be more of the status quo. The question for the undecided voter in a swing state is simple. A vote for RFK is useless. It's true some will stay home. Or leave the president question blank. But for undecided voters choosing Biden or Trump, the choice is between continuing the status quo. Whether they see that as good, bad, a mix or neither. Or, choose the candidate that they associate to a chaotic drama filled past and present. Had the GOP literally picked almost anyone else, the choice would have been easy. Do not be naive. Republicans knew the media could successfully paint this election as about Trump more than Biden. Trump does it to himself. Makes it too easy.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"2","postedAtMS":1718861940000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"Honestly, that's really just a cop out to knowing the

Democrats largely vote on fear. In 2018, it led to a blue wave. In 2020, it led to Biden winning, the Dems taking the house, barely losing the House in 2022, and the Dems barely taking the senate in 2020. Fear in part likely contributed to mitigating any \"red wave\" in 2022 also. It's probably helped in off cycle elections too. Blend that together with anger related to reproductive rights.In 2024, why would this be different? If you were the Dems, wouldn't you rather have your typical voters upset, in fear and angry, if it drives up turnout up just like last time? What Republicans don't understand is any idea of kissing up to Trump really does not serve any political advantage. It doesn't work with Independents. It will not turn out any more than who already is turning out. Having the same people cheering for you to make you feel good about yourself does not promote growth. To win elections, you need to go horizontal. Each vote you switch from the other party is a two vote swing. It's more easily able to do this than get more turnout from those who already won't vote. People who aren't voting are not going to a Trump rally and they usually aren't going to watch it online.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"8","downvotes":"2","postedAtMS":1718318520000,"replies":[{"opContent":"The Jewish vote completely flips the table on this","opAuthor":"Pyramid","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"3","postedAtMS":1718319960000,"replies":[{"opContent":"You have to be a bit more clear on what you are implying exactly. I am guessing from some of the rhetoric in your other comments you have a pro Trump or leaning GOP bias. So I guess what I am trying to ascertain is if you are implying Jewish voters are suddenly now going to vote GOP because of the Gaza conflict. Or, if it is about the debate of horizontal versus vertical.If it is the former, there is no data to support this is the case. If anything, Trump has disrespected Jewish Democrat voters by saying they must hate their religion if they vote Democrat. Jewish voters are not one dimensional one topic voters. They largely live in very liberal areas by demography and they are often part of the leadership in many of these places. Even if Israel were on their priority list, many other things are. Biden has backed Israel. Unlike Russia, the GOP and Dems not too far for the left (i.e. Biden, Obama, Clinton) are aligned on Israel. So what exactly would they be voting on that is different anyway? Given many Jewish Americans are culturally liberal more than the average of the population, they by proportion actually might be more likely to support Palestinian rights, or at least be empathetic. Obviously not to an anti Semitic bigot. But to a reasonable person, yes. What's the alternative? Supporting the guys who says there were some fine people on both sides, including Neo Nazis following them charging that anti Semitic line about not being replaced?In terms of the vertical method, with populations that are more educated than national average, like Indian Americans, other Asian Americans and Jewish Americans, their rate of voting is going to be higher in proportional percent than the average group of the US. If overall turnout is higher, it's reasonable to expect that in proportion relative to other groups with the same average educational attainment, that it will be the same.","opAuthor":"nyj01827","upvotes":"3","downvotes":"1","postedAtMS":1718323140000,"replies":[{"opContent":"I know plenty of single issue voters in NYC where that issue is support of Israel.

You are projecting what your individual encounters and experiences are on to millions of people. What we are talking about are macro level patterns. It's not to discount who you know but there is a social circle bias. Whether you want to admit it or not, you have a right leaning bias. We could look at your past comments if you don't believe me but you come off as honest enough to admit this. My point is what want to see (even if unintentionally) occur we will see, in terms of perception. Who you hang out with, if you live in NYC or the area, while probably includes a bit of liberal leaning friends, it probably is overrepresented by either conservatives, Republicans or Trump supporters. Birds of a feather flock together. It's not a knock on you. It just means who you know is not representative of a demographic group at large.Where exactly are you insisting these voters live anyway? You like to talk about polls yet there is no polling data to suggest that is the case for Jewish Americans, let alone NYC. I am not saying anti semitism isn't a real concern. What I am saying is it is Biden running, not Bernie or AOC. Moderate Dems are together with the GOP on this. If anything, the GOP has tried at times preventing funding to Israel because of Ukraine. The other issue too of course which you didn't want to address was that within the GOP itself, there are many antisemitic tropes. Marjorie and the Jewish space lasers, Fox News and it's obsession with Soros, conservatives and their conspiracy theories with the Rothchilds, saying neo nazis were part of some fine people, ect.You are really providing a severe oversimplification of what are very complex matters. Israelis, Jewish or not and religiously practicing or not, are very critical of their government, especially Netanyahu. There are dozens of political parties in a country that is small. There is division within Israel itself. There is of course lots of anger and frustration. But there is also a lack of agreement and consensus in how their government is choosing to navigate the struggle. If many Jewish people themselves are not even on the side of continuing the war in Gaza or not in the manner it has been going, what makes you think Jewish Americans are identifying as much with this as you would like to believe this?I am related to many Jewish people. I grew up in the NYC area. Policy related to the Gaza war is not a top priority for Jewish Americans. Most are concerned with the same mainstream issues everyone else is. Which is how much do my prescriptions cost, how much my student loans cost, how are my kids doing academically, what will my retirement look like, ect. For women, abortion rights are a concern. There are some people who solely focus on one or two issues but it's not the average person. They tend to obsessed with the topic. Like second amendment rights in a rural area. Or climate change within a yuppie community.The campus protests have cooled down and drawn down in national attention because of summer break. It's more like a special interest of college kids who feel like they need to believe in society. To say it is 5 percent of what the Civil Rights movement was, or 10 percent of BLM protests in 2020, would be an overstatement.Simply put, if you have the time to be able to focus on what's going on with Israel to feeling it at such a personal level, you probably are living a life of privilege or upper middle class. People with those types of upbringing have the luxury of thinking about Israel like thinking about climate change or artificial intelligence. Which when you grow up with that type of educational upbringing and circle, it means your circle is usually Democrat. And if it's in the NYC, DC, LA, Chicago, Philly or Boston areas, it's even more Democrat than that.Show us your data though. Antisemitism has gradually been on the rise for years now. The uptick in nunbers started during Trump's term actually, if you look at hate crime indexes via FBI publicly published data. Yet all of that made no meaningful impact in a chance in voting amongst Jewish Americans.You can screen shot all of this. We can talk it over in late November or Decenber. You won't have an explanation. You'll probably say Jewish voters voted the same again because of abortion rights or what ever you can come up with deflect from not accepting responsibility over a prediction based on no data.Do you have multiple polls specific to Jewish Americans, including in the NYC area, to support your claim? Or are we to take your word for it based on the 11 people you are referring to who think like you because birds of a feather flock

Exit polls show Trump with a commanding lead in both states, which is expected in these deep red strongholds. However, the margins are even larger than anticipated, with Trump leading by over 30 points in each. This sets an ominous tone for the Biden campaign.7:30pm - More polls close in North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia. Again, Trump substantially outperforms his 2020 numbers. He leads by double digits in all three states, even flipping the swing state of North Carolina back into the red column decisively. Cheers erupt at Trump headquarters while the mood at Biden's camp grows tense.8:00pm - A big wave of poll closings across the East Coast and Midwest: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C. Shockingly, Trump has pulled ahead in all of these states, even traditionally blue bastions in the Northeast. He holds a 5 point lead in New York, a 10 point advantage in New Jersey, and is running even with Biden in deep-blue Massachusetts and Maryland. A red wave is cresting.In Florida, a state Trump won narrowly in 2016 and 2020, he's ahead by a whopping 20 points. The Latino vote has swung massively in his favor. Even more stunning, Trump is winning the African American vote in many states, overperforming with this demographic by 30-40 points compared to 2020. It's an unprecedented shift.9:00pm - Polls close in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Trump tsunami shows no signs of abating. He's now leading in every state that's been called so far, and in the states too close to call.Wisconsin and Michigan, two critical swing states that narrowly went to Biden in 2020, are firmly in Trump's column this time. He's ahead by over 15 points in both. Minnesota, a state that's been blue since 1972, has also flipped to Trump. The upper Midwest is now a sea of red.Perhaps most stunningly, Trump holds a 10 point lead in New York and a 5 point edge in California. The entire West Coast is competitive. Audible gasps and a sense of disbelief are heard at Biden election night headquarters. The impossible seems to be happening.10:00pm - Polls close in Iowa, Montana, Nevada, and Utah. All are immediately called for Trump. He's now been declared the winner in 30 states and leads in all the rest. Biden has not been able to claim a single state. It's a wipeout of historic proportions.11:00pm - California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho polls close. Shockingly, Trump is quickly declared the winner in California, Oregon, and Washington - states that haven't gone Republican since the 1980s. He's winning by double digit margins up and down the West Coast. Idaho is also called for Trump as expected.12:00am - Polls close in Hawaii and Alaska. They too are immediately projected for Trump. He's now won all 50 states - the first clean sweep since George Washington in 1789 and 1792. The popular vote margin is enormous. Trump has won over 70% of the popular vote, the largest landslide in American history, surpassing FDR's 60.8% in 1936.At Trump headquarters, wild celebrations erupt. A huge throng of supporters chant \"USA! USA!\" and \"Four More Years!\" as Trump takes the stage to declare victory. In a gracious speech, he promises to be a president for all Americans and to heal the divisions in the country. He compliments Joe Biden on a hard fought race.On the other side, the mood at Biden HQ is funereal. Staffers weep and console each other. When Biden finally emerges to give his concession speech, he is gracious but shell-shocked. He congratulates Trump on his historic victory and urges the country to come together. But he seems dazed, struggling to comprehend the scale of his defeat.In the coming days, political pundits will pick apart the results of the 2024 election. Many credit Trump's stunning sweep to the roaring economic recovery that followed his 2016 victory. Others point to the chaotic Biden presidency from 2021-2024, which was plagued by inflation, crime, and foreign policy blunders. The successful Trump brokered Middle East peace deals and the landmark trade agreement with China also boosted his popularity. And the collapse of the Democratic party into the far left socialist wing drove many moderates to Trump.Regardless of the reasons, the result is clear - a resounding, 50 state mandate for Trump's America First agenda. He will enter his second term with more political capital than any president in modern American history. The 2024 election will be remembered as the night Trumpism triumphed over traditional politics in a landslide of unprecedented proportions. American elections will never be the same.","opAuthor":"MillardFillmoreFan","upvotes":"8","downvotes":"2","postedAtMS":1716356400000,"replies":[{"opContent":"The cope from this account is going to be epic","opAuthor":"spicymissile","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"0","postedAtMS":1716648000000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"The cope from this account is going to be epic","beginOffset":-1},"sentiment":{"magnitude":0.699999988079071,"score":0.699999988079071}}],"documentSentiment":{"magnitude":0.699999988079071,"score":0.699999988079071},"language":"en"}},{"opContent":"You realize even the most heavily Trump favoring polls still don't predict basically anything like this, right?","opAuthor":"csbets","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"1","postedAtMS":1716476340000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"You realize even the most heavily Trump favoring polls still don't predict basically anything like this, right?","beginOffset":-1},"sentiment":{"magnitude":0.8999999761581421,"score":-0.8999999761581421}}],"documentSentiment":{"magnitude":0.8999999761581421,"score":-0.8999999761581421},"language":"en"}},{"opContent":"You need a hobby other than writing unhinged fanfiction","opAuthor":"BasedGesualdo","upvotes":"1","downvotes":"3","postedAtMS":1716414240000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"You need a hobby other than writing unhinged fanfiction","beginOffset":-1},"sentiment":{"magnitude":0.20000000298023224,"score":-0.20000000298023224}}],"documentSentiment":{"magnitude":0.20000000298023224,"score":-0.20000000298023224},"language":"en"}},{"opContent":"Why, because the fascist declares himself dictator, executes his enemies, and cripples our country?","opAuthor":"lmvas712","upvotes":"2","downvotes":"2","postedAtMS":1716385680000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"Why, because the fascist declares himself dictator, executes his enemies, and cripples our country?","beginOffset":-1},"sentiment":{"magnitude":0.800000011920929,"score":-0.800000011920929}}],"documentSentiment":{"magnitude":0.800000011920929,"score":-0.800000011920929},"language":"en"}},{"opContent":"Nice AI fanfiction","opAuthor":"markl85442","upvotes":"1","downvotes":"1","postedAtMS":1716384840000,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"Nice AI fanfiction","beginOffset":-1},"sentiment":{"magnitude":0.8999999761581421,"score":0.8999999761581421}}],"documentSentiment":{"magnitude":0.8999999761581421,"score":0.8999999761581421},"language":"en"}}],"threadAvgScore":-0.05000000447034836,"threadScoreTotal":-0.30000002682209015,"threadCountTotal":6,"result":{"sentences":[{"text":{"content":"November 5th, 2024 -
