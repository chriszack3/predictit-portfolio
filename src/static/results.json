I'll give you that some of them are partisan in nature, but some aren't. At least he actually gets things done.What exactly did Trump get done on any of his promises? Like 90 percent on nothing.Did Obamacare get repealed and replaced? No. Did it get repealed? No. Did he offer what that replacement was? No. Did he have 53 GOP senators and a GOP house at the time? Yes.On the other side, meanwhile, Biden gets McConnell on board with infrastructure in a bipartisan way.Did Trump get an infrastructure deal done despite having a GOP led House and Senate for 2 years? Despite promising? No.Did Trump get an immigration deal done? Despite promising? No.Did Trump get North Korea to denuclearize? No. Did he make America look weak by saying Kim Jung Un had a beautiful vision for his country after Otto Warmbier was returned to us basically beaten to death? Yes.Trump said he would be tough on Russia. In Helsinki, he severely embarrassed our country by siding with Putin over the CIA and all intel organizations which he directly had authority over. Made us as much of a laughing stock only to get laughed at by the whole world when Trump was at the UN himself.Trump told us we would have a border wall with Mexico. He says there was a border wall, yet there are now tons of undocumented folks coming across the border? Are they going through an imaginary wall?On the last day of Trump's presidency, CBP on their site, another government agency under Trump's hand pick DHS secretary authority, said only 52 miles of new wall had been built. And only about 400 miles of new replacement fencing was installed. Only less than a quarter of the border.Trump said that he would eliminate the national debt in two terms. Instead, he created as much debt proportionately in one term as Obama in two terms.Trump promised a new Iran deal would be created. Never happened.Almost every promise he made never came true. Promises made, promises not kept.What did he accomplish beyond 3 supreme court justices, starting prison reform which was a Democrat interest, and making you feel warm and fuzzy inside? Diddly squat.",

If the answer is Republican or Independent but you voted Romney, McCain and Bush, or didn't vote, then as harsh as this sounds, though I genuinely say it as respectfully as one can, your vote is not doing anything to change this upcoming election.On my end, I live in Florida. I have since 2010. I am in mid-30s. When I live in NJ in '08 and voted Obama, that vote was not changing much. In 2012, in Florida when I voted Obama, one could argue that my vote actually did matter given how close it was. In 2016, I voted Hillary.I didn't like her much but Trump came off as an incompetent businessman given the 6 bankruptciee. His incompetent way of doing business and managing crisis came true during COVID, plus the massive racial unrest following Floyd's death, and his mismanagement of COVID spilled over in to a massive recession. He said he would be the greatest jobs president ever. Yet he ended with 6.3 percent unemployment following starting on day one with 5.0 percent the second he took over from Obama.Trump like every other politician like to the American people with unrealistic goals. Not even scratching the surface. Saying the national debt would be wiped out in 8 years under him. Meanwhile, he was nearly identically on pace as Obama in accruing more debt. That's what a showman does. They bullsh*t you because they are full of sh*t. He became like every other politician except worse because he is lazy. If you too lazy to read a briefing, you too lazy to run a country. Lied to us too saying he would surround himself with the best only layer on to whine about his secretary of state, UN Ambassador, attorney General and even his VP.Understand this, a vote for Biden is more a vote against Trump than a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden. It is how I see it and it was how moderates, Independents and undecided voters saw it in 2020. I am an Independent and there are issues I am to the left (i.e. labor union rights, health care, LGBTQ rights, supporting Ukraine against Russia in their war), some issues I am in the middle on (i.e. immigration, policy on Gaza and Palestine, policy related to reproductive rights, policy related to climate change, and 2nd amendment rights) and to the right on (i.e. seeing some of the pros of drilling state side, preferring to buy products made in the US, supporting police though I see that as intertwined with supporting unions). On some of rhe moderate issues, I lean more center ledt. On other issues, I am more center right.But for me, it's always been a given that Trump has had severe issues of moral deprivation and poor character. The bigger issue is the dude just couldn't bring the bacon home.At this point, voting Republican period would be very hard. It's not just about Trump anymore. I see there fundamentally being something wrong with people who are selectively silent with zero willingness to speak out when their leader is in the wrong morally, ethically or is simply sucking in their performance. I would have always heard Romney, McCain and Bush, and their supporters out. I don't like a lot of what the Dem party does at times. But it's become evident which party promotes thinking and freedom of thought and expression. And which one expects compliance and shutting your mouth when it's politically inconvenient no matter how unethical. That's why I vote Dem.",

                "opContent": "When the shift happens both on RCP and HQ polling averages too, the prices will change more. Same if the 538 Forecast moves. Right now the 538 Forecast is 50 out of 100 for both Biden and Trump. On RCP, Trump is +0.6 in the H2H and +0.9 in the 5 way. 538 doesn't do a national polling average for H2H. At least not that I have seen. They only included RFK Jr.Nationally, RFK Jr and Biden are splitting. A couple days ago, in the Fox News poll where they asked RFK Jr voted who they would vote for between, 47 percent said Trump, 47 percent said Biden. The difference is RFK Jr pulls more from Biden than Trump in Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. Whereas, RFK Jr pulls more from Trump than Biden in Wisconsin and Michigan, and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania and Arizona.Generally speaking, the more white and more college educated share of a Democratic polling share is, he is less supported by Dems, relative to the GOP. His support comes more from low information voters. Luckily for Biden, the Dem voting share is whiter and more college educated in PA, MI, WI, NE CD 02, MN and AZ. Because all of those minus AZ equal exactly 270 EVs. And Arizona though going Trump right now is closer than all of the others, and has 11 EVs, as a back up to WI (10 EVs, which was the tipping state in both '16 and '20).For Biden, I would say the bigger issue is that somewhat with Stein but even more with Cornel West, those voters if they were to vote in the 2 way, would be more likely to go Biden. The two of them probably will combined not get more than the same 1.7-1.8 percent 3rd party candidates received in all elections between 2000 to 2020, excluding 2016. Whereas with RFK Jr, it's more unique to see a 3rd party candidate pulling equally from both a Dem and GOP presidential candidate.If Stein and C. West for example together take 1.1 out of that 1.8 that would have gone to Biden and only 0.5 from Trump, that 0.6 percent could be very important in the upper Midwest. Especially in states where C. West has tried appealing to Muslim voters with pro Palestine rhetoric, like Michigan and to a lesser extent Minnesota.As that relates to your question, without having the 5 way poll, it means the polling averages both nationally and state level, will slant a little more towards Biden than Trump. Whereas Biden is +0.1 in the 3 way 538 national average, Trump is +0.9 in the 5 way. That is a gap of 1.0 percent.However, that theory may be wrong too, because with HQ in their 3 way without Stein and West, it's +0.9 Trump as well.With Wisconsin and Michigan, it's all running at or less than 1 percent, or even less than a half percent, whether H2H, 3 way or 5 way, on multiple of RCP, HQ and 538. There isn't enough polling data coming out of Minnesota or Nebraska CD 02, but it's usually so that it runs more blue than MI WI PA. With more polling come out of there, it may give Biden a slight boost in gambling markets by a cent or two.Between RCP, 538 and HQ, whether 2 way, 3 way or 5 way, Pennsylvania is ranging from +1.3 to +2.9 Trump. The  +2.9 outlier is the 5 way RCP. Everything else between all of HQ, 538 and RCP, doesn't go above +2.0 for Trump.When you see Pennsylvania's polling averages move to where Wisconsin and Michigan, which is likely to occur after Biden holds his own or better in the debate like he always has and after Trump's sentencing, you'll start to see this move. On Polymarkets, PA has been slightly leading Biden for a while now.In both '16 and '20, PA was not the tipping state. It was Pennsylvania predicted by experts both times with Wisconsin as the other possibility. And lots of people both times predicted it would be PA. Turned out being WI as tpping state.  With a more popular Dem governor than last time, along with PA having elected a Dem senator since, I don't see PA being more to the right than WI, or WI being more to the left. At best, even.",

If you look at the RCP, 538 or HQ average, if looking at MI, PA and WI, they are all having polling averages that are very close to national average now. This wasn't anywhere near the case with Biden in 2020. It's because these three states have not shifted as right relative to national average as NV, AZ, GA and NC have. It is also because in the upper rustbelt RFK takes more from Trump than Biden, whereas RFK takes more from Biden in the sunbelt and slightly more in other regions in the US.MI and WI now run slightly left to the national average, with or without RFK Jr included. MI is running about even H2H, while running slightly blue with RFK Jr on the ballot. WI is also running even. Or on HQ, +2.4 Biden with RFK. With Pennsylvania, it's +1.0 Trump  with RFK Jr, or +1.7 without him, on HQ.Trump is +0.8 on the polling averages. You'd literally have to use the best case scenario in PA on RCP with RFK included for +3.0, for it to be a +2.2 right awing from the national popular vote average. If HQ is correct, then it is +0.2 that Dems would need to win by to secure getting to 270 with PA, MI and WI.So if Fox News is indeed correct which you seem to be accepting of and not arguing against, you are comfortable with the idea of the Dems only needing anywhere from +0.2 to +2.2 to win.You do realize how much Trump was of a failure as a president going against an incumbent with approval on the high 30s you are accepting those polls are fact implying that it is basically 50/50 and decided by 43,000 votes to 77,000 votes in 3 states again like 2016 and 2020, right? In the past, you would have complained the polls were fake. Yet look at the pretzel you talked yourself in to with liking the polls now.Just wait until it is the Republican party of NE you wind up blaming for Trump losing in 2024 when Biden wins exactly 270. You should screen shot that.",

The issue with RCP is they have included right wing bias garbage companies that get D or F ratings like Traflagar.It is a close election. Just like 2016 and 2020. People mostly will be voting the same way they did last time and the time before that. It is hyoerpartisan times. Whether Biden is +2, Trump is +1, or they are even, in nationally polling, is generally not important. What is important is what the polling averages say in MI, WI and PA. Probably MN too but it seems very unrealistic for Trump to win NE 02 or MN without taking at least one or more of MI, WI and PA. This is where the math to get to 270 is. AZ is a back up plan to if Biden slightly loses WI. GA is the back up to MI. GA + NV would be the back up to PA. It's less reliable pathways in either case. They shouod keep canpaigning heavily there along with FL and NC to get the GOP to waste resources playing defense.Even RCP has Biden even with Trump in MI now and slightly leading with RFK, Stein and West included. It's slightly to Biden on RCP in WI, but better on 538 and a bit better better than not Biden on HQ. Slightly too with MI. PA right now seems to be a little more challenging than the other two. The good thing for Biden is Shapiro is more popular than Whitmer and Evers. There are a lot of black voters in Philly and Pittsburgh who like in previous elections will come home.",

They said 79 percent of black voters in 2020 approved of Biden in polling prior to the election and that 91 percent wound up voting for Biden. So much of those inroads the GOP is really counting on making with black voters seem to be diminishing.Meanwhile, the FOXNEWS poll said Biden has a +15 favorability from elderly voters age 65+. This has consistently been America's most consistent high voting demographic for decades. This same Fox poll has Biden up +28 with college educated women. They show up in high percentages to vote too. Biden's score in the polls are also up a little bit from where it previously was on the economy and immigration.Trump supporters, this is coming from Fox News. Because it's reporting data, it must all be fake news, right? So you can't deny the credibility of the poll. So what other option is there? Ah, silence. Classic for those who hate America by flying upside down American flags like Alito's wife. We have soldiers fighting for your freedom for that flag while you support a fat coward who criticizes war veterans as not heroes. This hatred of America waving upside down flags is classic for those who hate police who say nothing in defense of the numbers of police that were severely injured on Jan 6 due to a bunch of QAnon'ers who largely have been prosecuted and rightfully so.",

For the record though, you had no rebuttal against anything from that specific poll. Yet you have not called it fake news. You can see how conveniently selective silence comes off cowardly, right? Even if you disagree, you should at least understand the optics of that.Any time you guys grow cry mode you go to some random word like Marxist or Leninist. Which seems to do nothing with the middle.Trump practically is a socialist. When his trade war woth China was skyrocketing the cost on agricultural goods and metals bankrupting by farmers in ruby red Midwestern states by the drove, he went full Lenin on giving a huge socialist type package to farmers. Talk about a socialist inflationist.Trump was in practice as big a spender as a socialist. The national debt grew in greater proportion by Trump in one term relative to Obama's two terms. Trump said he would eliminate the national debt in 8 years. He had the same build up of national debt or worse relative to Obama. And you wonder how that, a recession, racial unrest he could not manage and a million Covid deaths in about 9 months (the highest per capita of any industrialized country) led to him ending as a one term loser with an approval average never getting out of the 40s at any point during his presidency and staying low 40s for most of it?The dude spends out of his you know what. You and I know that's not the conservative way.Trump approved stimulus packages for the public. If he does it, you say it's amazing and considerate for the people. If Biden does it, even a couple months ago, and you call him a Marxist or Leninist. You really think undecided voters in the upper rest belt don't know the difference between when you guys play politics or not? Go ahead, ask those +15 supporting Biden who are age 65+, according to yesterday's June poll on your beloved Fox News that kisses Trump's butt on the regularTrump won them 50-48 last time and is now losing this bloc where 2/3 of them vote in droves. Yet you guys are going wild over over gains made with younger voters that are already coming home to Dems and voters 18-29 have barely even 1/4 turnout. And when turnout is low, they turn out guess. Guess who consistently still turns out though? Elderly voters and women in the suburbs, especially white women and especially women with college education. You'll love to meet those Philly and Pittsburgh suburban voters on the PA side, those suburban voter in and around Detroit, and in and around Trump's horrible Milwaukee come early November.",

As though you calling anything laughable matters to any reader on here? You talk about the point at hand so you can convince people. No one is because convinced off yoir reputation on here. Look at the responses and consistent negative votes outnumbered positive votes you get on here.Trump could have blocked the COVID bills. You know what makes Trump the biggest wimp? He has promoted skepticism against the COVID vaccine directly while simultaneously trying to take credit for it. He is trying to play both sides within Republicans. Yet they don't believe he is a politician when that is exactly what a politician does. He tells the sensible moderate Republicans take the vaccine I helped lead the creation of, while pandering to the other half with conspiracy theories. It didn't make those conspiracy theorist end folks in the GOP happy either. But what did they do? Shut their mouths like cowards and mostly still show up to vote. With the progressive leftist end supporting Palestine, they'll mostly be voting for Biden too on the basis of the level of two evils they'll go with. But at least they have the courage to call Biden out.What did the idiot Facebooking conservative mom who loves the idea that autism is caused by vaccines gave to say against Trump when Trump bragged he created the vaccine and everyone should get it? Nothing. You know why? Because if you standing on line for that Kool Aid in late 1970s Guyana and you turn around and criticize what is in the punch, everyone calls you disloyal and worthless and won't associate with you. Meanwhile, pro Israel moderate Dems keep working with their pro Palestinian wing of the party and respect their freedom of speech.Trump had the choice not to sign those socialist COVID stimulus checks. It was his pen. He did it because at the time he thought that's politically what the middle wanted.Why didn't you answer the point about Trump ending with a national deficit significantly higher? On same proportion as Obama. He promised to end the war in Afghanistan but was too cowardly to have the courage to end it because of the bad optics that would come so he continued to cost American lives in a war going no where for 4 more years, while continuing to burden the tax payer.Trump enabled those 23 Democratic governors to shut down their economies. His voice influenced what the other 27 governors did. The issue was Trump couldn't make up his mind. His political inexperience and general indecisiveness was showing. His own staff said he was too lazy to read his briefings. When you flip flop saying to shut down one day, that we should open the next day, the vaccines are bad one day, that they are amazing the next day, this confuses everyone. As much as I think RFK Jr is a buffoon, at least he remains consistent. At least he knows he will take flack for ridiculous statements and doesn't cry like a baby when he gets called out on it like Trump.",

Just like it was completely inappropriate for Clarence Thomas to have his wife participate in an effort to illegally overturn the election while not refusing himself and yet continuing to get paid for trips and free jet rides from rich  conservative partisans. Sad thing for Trump is, his election fraud claims were such bogus even when it came across Alito and Thomas desk they had no other choice than to immediately reject it unanimously with this fellow SOTU judges.

Has nothing to do with Kelly. He also disrespected the Khan gold star family. He has disrespected service people by saying he would fix the VA when he did nothing and even in the 2020 election continued to complain how much of a mess it was. He was part of why it was never fixed just like he was the a big part of the reason a new Iran deal never happened as promised, why the ACA was never repealed nor replaced despite having a GOP led house and senate for 2 years, and his disrespecting of McCain probably had a lot to do with that critical vote too), why an infrastructure deal never happened despite having a GOP led House and Senate for 2 years (meanwhile Biden got Mitch on board to get it done while barely having a majority in the senate), why North Korea never denuclearized as promised (and how he embarrassed our country by saying Kim Jung Un - a guy who tortures and starves his people, including feeding his own uncle to dogs, is a man with a beautiful vision, while his prison guards tortured a US citizen in Otto Warmbier, with NK refused to take any responsibility for). He also lied saying that the national deficit would get wiped out under him, yet he by proportion accrued more debt in 1 term than Obama.He honestly really did not accomplish much. Just the run of the mill GOP Reagen or Bush type tax cuts, following inheriting an economy with 7+ years from Obama and 5.0 percent unemployment, all to end his term with 6.3 percent unemployment in a recession. Besides that, the only other thing he did was get gun reform started, which actually was something Democrats wanted, not Republicans. Which Republicans cowered on that and couldn't stand up to Koresh on that. I'll give him that he got 3 Supreme Court justices on, but that really had more to do with McConnell and timing. Everything else was drama, chaos and failure. He was too thin skinned to hold it together once the Mueller investigation was going. As president, investigations happen. You shut your mouth, govern and keep the ball moving. All he did was whine. Whining is nor productive. It doesn't make any more people join you than we're already with you. It just annoys the people not on your side and even makes people roll their eyes on his side and say can we move on to the issues. He just does not have the ability to focus. He wouldn't even read his briefings. He is a showman who blows hot air and half butts it on everything. Jewish voters in NYC know exactly the type of person he has been for decades. They were liberals who did not appreciate him saying the central park 5 should be executed and had nothing to say when their convictions were overturned.Born with a golden spoon, not having to work for crap in his life. Inherited the equivalent of 391 million. Did not pay taxes and went bankrupt 6 times because he couldn't effectively run his businesses. Would have made more just sitting on the real estate and interest. Pretty sad when you think about it. This is his character. 60 percent of America knows it and believes it. About 5 to 7 percent knows it but will vote for him or RFK Jr as a means to not vote Biden or for most Dems.Regarding about +15 on the elderly approval of Biden which I appreciate you acknowledging, what I was getting at with that is that number is higher than he received by a good margin compared to 2020. Trump won the elderly vote 50-48 in 2020. So if Biden is running a +15 with them, that's a good sign for him. As opposed to the black disapproval for Biden fluctuating all over the place and polls showing a predictable coming home effect back to Dems now. Same with Latino voters in varying states to a lesser extent.",

Because they can't make up their mind with Fox News. Conservatives love watching their Fox and Friends, or Watters giving Trump a colonoscopy daily with his face, or Gutfeld acting like a buffoon. But, when they start putting out polls that Trump and his base don't like, then it's fake news, right? When they call AZ ahead of everyone else by days and even the election itself as soon as it could even to liberals surprise, than it's fake news again, right?The fake news argument doesn't work with Independents, moderates and undecided voters. It's just a rah rah rally around thing for conservatives to have a partisan talking point on.We have discussed other topics on here and I do know you make a concerted effort to have a conversation with a respectful overtone even when we disagree, which I do appreciate.What I think you really are misunderstanding is a few fundamental realities that is clouding your judgement. You should ask people close to you, but not Jewish, and ideally not sharing your same political partisanship, if you disagree with me.Like it or not, Jewish Americans are a relatively small demographic bloc that is disproportionately populated in very liberal cities and Metropolitan areas. All of New York, New Jersey, Florida (for GOP), Arizona (Biden does not need it to win because MI, WI, PA, MN and NE 02 are running very left of AZ, NV, GA and NC, yet with all those states gets to exactly 270), plus Massachussetts, California and Illinois, are all very blue, we already know will be red, or are purple but not going to construct in how Biden hits 270 in the most winnable path The Jewish population in PA, MI and WI are small. What, like 2-3 percent each? PA even has a Jewish Dem governor with high approval and he is moderate. Even if the overwhelming majority of Jews voted red in your supposed hypothesis, it would not be enough in any of those very blue states to electorally matter. The reality is though the polling doesn't support that any of those states competitive for Republicans. And the data has shown that the Jewish disapproval of Trump is extremely high. And that the Jewish favorability of Trump is low.Do you know how many of these mainstream media companies, and social media companies have Jewish owners or leadership or journalists? If what you are implying is true about Jewish voters going red, why is there no articles or data being published supporting this argument? What would be in it for the media to suppress that article, but not one about possible erosion woth younger, black or Latino voters? For Jewish voters, the rate of having a college education is higher than the average of the US. This contributes to being higher information voters and more complex voters taking a diversity of issues in to consideration when voting. Education rates are higher in the community compared relatively to national average. The political partisanship of most of these individuals historically has been liberal. Jewish people have had to fight that discrimination from conservatives for years for this.Jewish leaders were and have been on the Frontline of the Civil Rights movement. They have been part of the leadership of labor rights movements. Bernie Sanders is iconic to this today and he himself is Jewish. Jewish leaders have disproportionately been part of the Democrat party more than the Republican party. They are now much more educated than the average of the general population, and those with higher education are now currently the bedrock of the moderate Democrats who silently back candidates like Obama, Clinton and Biden, day in and day out.If Jewish voters were breaking towards Trump, where is the data? Talking to your family and friends in your bias political circle is not evidence. Show me the data. You really believe this wouldn't be a story if it were true. It's a story if Muslims in Michigan do a protest primary vote against Biden, its a story if black voters disapprove of Biden in higher numbers in the past, and it's a story if Biden struggled with Latinos. But it is not a story if Jewish voters are breaking towards Trump in these supposed record numbers you are telling us about? Despite there being many Jewish journalist reporters who probably would have a ton of interest in this, especially in NYC, where you obsessed with this the most?So Jewish voters are going to turn their backs on the labor movement, on unions, on Universal health care or ACA pushes, LGBTQ rights, Ukraine (who has a Jewish president, going against Russia who has had a long history of antisemitism), Jewish women will turn their backs on reproductive rights, and so on?  All to join a presidential candidate in Trump who has had a history to pandering to anti Semitic tropes such as saying \"both sides had some fine people\" in Charlottesville? You do realize they were literally on national TV chanting \"Jews will not replace us?\" While holding torches up. You do realize Jewish voters are much higher information voters than the average and they were well aware of this in 2020 when voting heavily for Biden? Anti semitism grew during the Trump Admin. Synongauges ending up with graffiti on the daily. Go ahead and look on Google yourself with the dates from the Trump Admin.I recommend you discussing with those not politically aligned to you, but close to you, if there are any, because you are too close to the issue to think objectively about it. You either are or are closely related to a small number of Jewish voters who have made up their mind about Israel and voting. What you are not realizing is actually simple though. It's that on policy, Biden and Trump are similar on Israel. At least as it pertains to this war. And Biden and Trump have both had their criticism of Netanyahu which is honestly nothing compared to the average Israeli. The logic most Jewish Democrats or Dem leaning Independents apply here is that policy on the conflict in Hamas is not changing even if there is a change in Admin. Most I've spoken have said they'd expect antisemitism to embolden because Trump has been welcoming to white supremacists, such as telling the Proud Boys to stand by and stand back. In a debate of all places.Trump has also spoken well of QAnon which promotes antisemitic conspiracy theories involving Jewish elites, including the Rothchilds and Soros. And Marjorie's space lasers.When Trump called Jewish voters disloyal for heavily voting Democrat, his favorability went down double digits from in the 70s to the 80s in a poll. The polls only count if you like what they say though, otherwise it's fake news, right?Trump called the Israeli Jewish Council brutal killers and he told them they had no other choice to vote for him in 2019. Sounds like the nonsense he spews today. How'd that work out in 2020? About in 10 Jewish voters voting for Biden? Google the Assiciated Press article. It says in 2020, 69 percent voted for Biden. 73 percent said they thought Trump has had too much tolerance for extremist hate groups.High educated voters than the average are higher information voters who go deeper with more complex reasoning and critical thinking. They are not one issue voters. Most voters have at least 3-5+ issues on their mind they are voting on. For most Jewish voters,",

Things are much more calm and less chaotic under Biden.Where are there these riots or protests in the street you are talking about? Charlottesville was supposedly unite the right versus Antifa? Where are these two groups currently fighting it out? Internet message boards? Facebook? Lol Even social media and misinformation right wing OANs and Newsmax type networks aren't claiming they are interacting in person.You are probably seeing your Republican voting dad, brother and cousins screaming in the living room at their TV or phone every night about how Biden is the worse thing on earth.

They thought it was a wash but that it turned out to be Trump trying to shout over Biden and Biden telling him won't you just shut up man. Do you know how humiliating that line was to Trump?

You understand there are some battles you may lose but you learn from it to try to do better the next time.In Trump's philosophy, he is not allowed to ever lose. It's either he won or he won. His ego is too thin skinned for politics. He has psychological issues that interfere with his ability to accept you can't control what others think about you. It's like he is permanently in the state of mind of a mentally unstable 14 year old girl who loses it every time someone says something mean about her.When you are a president, a manager, a military general, a teacher, a doctor, or anyone with authority, being criticized by those with less power is part of the game. Trying to micromanage that criticism is what a pu..y wimp does. And it projects weakness which comes off as annoying to Independents.",

Whine, cry, moan.  What makes you think Trump won't still try shouting without the mic? Or that his ego won't be fragile and won't just walk off the stage?Put yourself in an Independent or undecided voters shoes for a second. Trump is talking about how Biden will show up doped up. Yet never mentioning what exactly there is even out there one can dope up on? Can you see how that is being perceived as a cowardly out to if and when Joe holds his own or even potentially wins the debate?How does this way of operating support the idea of putting up or shutting up and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps?

He is too lazy and incompetent to effectively lead let alone be a dictator. So in all honestly, the US could survive one more term of either of them.Ask yourself this. There were people who said your words 4 years ago. Where are we now? Trump literally said in the debate if Biden won, the stock market would crash. How did that work out in 2021? How is it working out now?On May 19, you probably said the same thing you did just now. Just like you did on April 19. Go ahead and look at your past comments. If the US will be fully here on July 19, August 19 and September 19, what really is going on that is making you think it won't be 4 years from now?We both know you live a fairly normal life where nothing all that crazy or unusual is going on. You both got jobs. Probably got a dog. Fridge full of food. Eating out at restaurants. Watching sports and movies.There is nothing theatrical going on, buddy. Now, let's compare our lives to 4 years ago. George Floyd protests. Everyone wearing masks. People dying or hospitalized everywhere due to Covid while Trump couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to shut down or open. Whether he wanted to listen to Fauci or not. And then when he didn't, be too cowardly to fire him despite saying he wanted to. As a leader, you must be decisive. Trump was only concerned with doing what he thought was best for him politically. Not good for the recession as evidenced by a recession. And not good for anyone's health as evidenced by a million deaths in a short period of time, the highest per capita rate of any industrialized country.Look, Biden is the incumbent. Incumbent usually run for reelection and mostly unchallenged within it's party. It is just a fact. With Republicans, they reasonably had other options. 30 percent or so wanted Haley. 45-50 percent of the GOP is with Trump like they are a Branch Davidian. 30 percent are the Haley voter type, some of them will go Trump, some will stay home, some will go Biden, some will go RFK or Stein. The issue for the GOP is that other 20-25 percent. They couldn't unite behind Haley and they were not going to for DeSantis because that vote was being divided.So half the party of those not quite Trump base but conservatives are forced to have less competitive chances to beat Biden because the other half of the GOP worships him no matter what says or does or if he fails miserably. There is no accountability.The only thing the GOP had to do was nominate Haley. You guys are all about believing the polls now because you really like to moderately like what it says. You remember when it had Haley up like +11 to +17 on Biden in some states? The upper midwest (which has the math to determine the election) would not be 50/50ish. It would have been 80-90ish in Haley's favor. She would have taken EVs Trump will not come wuthin 3 points of. Minnesota, Nebraska CD 02, and she would have run close probably even in Virginia and New Hampshire. She may have even made Colorado and New Mexico toss up states in this election cycle.Instead, what there is is a coin flip election like 2016 and 2020. The facts speak for themselves.",

The best I can do here is reduce the situation to the core problem we have at hand. Approximately 50% of the country has culturally been left behind and been belittled. They are not happy, they feel cheated by media, by the administrative state, by their schools, by every institution currently run by college graduates indoctrinated into woke Marxism.2024 is the last chance for a political solution. If justice is not served, I'm telling you right now those 50% are opting out. Not in the sense of States leaving the union, but in the sense of widespread disobedience, and non-recognition of federal authority that will just snowball into uglier and uglier conflicts until it all falls apart",

You are discussing with someone who has their facts straight while is maintaining a tone of respect and cordialness and is acknowledging and appreciating the same of you. No one else is complaining. It is just me and you discussing. If you would prefer a different forum, let me know what your preference is. But this forum is fine. I promise to read what you write as you have taken the time and consideration to do the same for me. What we are discussing is related to the election. For high information readers, they'll probably appreciate as opposed to the common posts of idiotic memes. It's always better to raise complexity than dumb down and cut corners.You stated 50 percent of the country feels this way. Please share your data for why you have reached that conclusion. Once you hit the word woke and Marxism, that's when you hit the rah rah rally around the circle GOP talking points. Only about 1/3 of the US is Democrat. 1/3 is Republican. And 1/3 is Independent or non party affiliated. What you are describing mostly is the Trump base. And that is only roughly about 37-38 percent of the country. Most of which are Republicans and some of which are GOP leaning Independents. There is another 9-10 percent or so that usually typically in a two party race with no competitive 3rd party candidate, will typically vote GOP. This was essentially the mainline Republican that was a never Trumper, where 21 percent voted for Haley in the primary in Indiana as an example even months after she dropped out of the race. They are a huge chunk of that 9-10 percent. And they are a huge chunk of that RFK Jr vote coming from the GOP end.If they preferred Nikki Haley, a member of the former GOP mainstream establishment prior to Trump, who criticized Trump very hard while running against him, how exactly are these voters part of some supposed 50 percent bloc of feeling culturally belittled and left behind?If that's the case, why continuing voting Haley after she dropped out? Is it that they realize that Trump is just a swamp monster like the swamp he couldn't drain out? Now picking from one of the standard bearer career GOP politician career politician before 2016 pool, again? Or, are they just similar to moderate Dems in how they think and operate?So supporting an obese 78 year old with a fragile ego, extremely thin skin, basic decency and family morals, and a record of chaos, mismanagement, incompetence, a lack of a record of following through on more than 80 to 90 percent of his promises, and a record of losing to a guy who campaigned nearly entirely virtually until the end, is the option? The guy who has become so lazy or exhausted he campaigns in non competitive areas like the Bronx and New Jersey? While falling asleep in court on more than one occasion due to exhaustion, not exercising, dealing with the ongoing stress of sentencing and more criminal trials, embarrassing himself saying Nikki Haley was House Speaker instead of Pelosi 7 times, trying to clean that up weeks later using a word to try to explain it that was not anywhere near the definition of anything he was actually explaining, plus calling Ronny Jackson Ronny Johnson multiple times while attempting to insult Biden in real time. What ever zip he had on his fastball is gone. He offers no new ideas and no innovation. He is mostly just concerned with his bruised ego from his criminal conviction, avoiding prosecution in the federal cases and Georgia, and occasionally still crying about the 2020 election.My friend, it will just be more of the same old. If Trump gets elected, Dems will do everything they can to interfere with anything he tries to do. The media will manipulate him so bad his ego won't be able to take it. It will be political gridlock with nothing getting done. Just more investigations. His approval will be low 40s at best. The tariffs he wants to put in place will fall on the shoulders of Americans buying goods and the media will run non stop on it painting the economy as garbage. It will position a Dem president taking over in 2028, following a failed GOP president like Bush leaving on 2008 passing it on to Obama.If Biden wins, what really can those part of that 38 percent, or as you exxageratingly assume about 50 percent, do? You are speaking figuratively. The US will still go on and exist.I think you really overestimate how engaged people actually are. So much of the youth and a good amount of millenials are not politically engaged. They tend to be low information voters who are on IG and Tik Tok too much getting their news from there and Snapchat. They really don't care enough one way or another. It would be a blessing if they cared or had half the concentration you are implying they do, just to even feel like they are being left out. You are probably a bit older. You really may not understand what cell phones have done to their generations. Kids who skated by in school for a decade playing on their phone half the time. Because their parents convinced themselves it was needed for their social status or for emergencies even though if there were an emergency the school Admin or office would call right in to the classroom to get hold of them. Teachers don't try micromanaging these kids behaviors on phones. It's easy in elementary, but they give up in middle and high school. These kids don't know what the words Marxism mean. A lot of them really are barely even aware of what is going on in Hamas. They have already checked out from everything you claim they will check out from and the reason they have checked out is because of how they were raised or not raised. It wasn't about politics, Biden or Trump.You want to know the truth? If Biden wins, they'll be gridlock from the GOP, but it'll be more of the status quo. The question for the undecided voter in a swing state is simple. A vote for RFK is useless. It's true some will stay home. Or leave the president question blank. But for undecided voters choosing Biden or Trump, the choice is between continuing the status quo. Whether they see that as good, bad, a mix or neither. Or, choose the candidate that they associate to a chaotic drama filled past and present. Had the GOP literally picked almost anyone else, the choice would have been easy. Do not be naive. Republicans knew the media could successfully paint this election as about Trump more than Biden. Trump does it to himself. Makes it too easy.",

The younger voters will come home to Biden due to Occam's razor.  This is a case of youth being idealistic.  And pretty removed from politics.  I mean when I was their age,  I voted for Nader over Gore (in a state that didn't matter) because Gore seemed like a sellout at the time and no different than Bush.However they will learn who Trump is, and their pragamatism will take over.I'd move it closer to 85-15, but there is a real possibility that something is not right with Biden.  Biden in a coma is still a better choice than Trump, but perhaps not all will see it that way.",

In 2020, it led to Biden winning, the Dems taking the house, barely losing the House in 2022, and the Dems barely taking the senate in 2020. Fear in part likely contributed to mitigating any \"red wave\" in 2022 also. It's probably helped in off cycle elections too. Blend that together with anger related to reproductive rights.In 2024, why would this be different? If you were the Dems, wouldn't you rather have your typical voters upset, in fear and angry, if it drives up turnout up just like last time? What Republicans don't understand is any idea of kissing up to Trump really does not serve any political advantage. It doesn't work with Independents. It will not turn out any more than who already is turning out. Having the same people cheering for you to make you feel good about yourself does not promote growth. To win elections, you need to go horizontal. Each vote you switch from the other party is a two vote swing. It's more easily able to do this than get more turnout from those who already won't vote. People who aren't voting are not going to a Trump rally and they usually aren't going to watch it online.",

I am guessing from some of the rhetoric in your other comments you have a pro Trump or leaning GOP bias. So I guess what I am trying to ascertain is if you are implying Jewish voters are suddenly now going to vote GOP because of the Gaza conflict. Or, if it is about the debate of horizontal versus vertical.If it is the former, there is no data to support this is the case. If anything, Trump has disrespected Jewish Democrat voters by saying they must hate their religion if they vote Democrat. Jewish voters are not one dimensional one topic voters. They largely live in very liberal areas by demography and they are often part of the leadership in many of these places. Even if Israel were on their priority list, many other things are. Biden has backed Israel. Unlike Russia, the GOP and Dems not too far for the left (i.e. Biden, Obama, Clinton) are aligned on Israel. So what exactly would they be voting on that is different anyway? Given many Jewish Americans are culturally liberal more than the average of the population, they by proportion actually might be more likely to support Palestinian rights, or at least be empathetic. Obviously not to an anti Semitic bigot. But to a reasonable person, yes. What's the alternative? Supporting the guys who says there were some fine people on both sides, including Neo Nazis following them charging that anti Semitic line about not being replaced?In terms of the vertical method, with populations that are more educated than national average, like Indian Americans, other Asian Americans and Jewish Americans, their rate of voting is going to be higher in proportional percent than the average group of the US. If overall turnout is higher, it's reasonable to expect that in proportion relative to other groups with the same average educational attainment, that it will be the same.",

What we are talking about are macro level patterns. It's not to discount who you know but there is a social circle bias. Whether you want to admit it or not, you have a right leaning bias. We could look at your past comments if you don't believe me but you come off as honest enough to admit this. My point is what want to see (even if unintentionally) occur we will see, in terms of perception. Who you hang out with, if you live in NYC or the area, while probably includes a bit of liberal leaning friends, it probably is overrepresented by either conservatives, Republicans or Trump supporters. Birds of a feather flock together. It's not a knock on you. It just means who you know is not representative of a demographic group at large.Where exactly are you insisting these voters live anyway? You like to talk about polls yet there is no polling data to suggest that is the case for Jewish Americans, let alone NYC. I am not saying anti semitism isn't a real concern. What I am saying is it is Biden running, not Bernie or AOC. Moderate Dems are together with the GOP on this. If anything, the GOP has tried at times preventing funding to Israel because of Ukraine. The other issue too of course which you didn't want to address was that within the GOP itself, there are many antisemitic tropes. Marjorie and the Jewish space lasers, Fox News and it's obsession with Soros, conservatives and their conspiracy theories with the Rothchilds, saying neo nazis were part of some fine people, ect.You are really providing a severe oversimplification of what are very complex matters. Israelis, Jewish or not and religiously practicing or not, are very critical of their government, especially Netanyahu. There are dozens of political parties in a country that is small. There is division within Israel itself. There is of course lots of anger and frustration. But there is also a lack of agreement and consensus in how their government is choosing to navigate the struggle. If many Jewish people themselves are not even on the side of continuing the war in Gaza or not in the manner it has been going, what makes you think Jewish Americans are identifying as much with this as you would like to believe this?I am related to many Jewish people. I grew up in the NYC area. Policy related to the Gaza war is not a top priority for Jewish Americans. Most are concerned with the same mainstream issues everyone else is. Which is how much do my prescriptions cost, how much my student loans cost, how are my kids doing academically, what will my retirement look like, ect. For women, abortion rights are a concern. There are some people who solely focus on one or two issues but it's not the average person. They tend to obsessed with the topic. Like second amendment rights in a rural area. Or climate change within a yuppie community.The campus protests have cooled down and drawn down in national attention because of summer break. It's more like a special interest of college kids who feel like they need to believe in society. To say it is 5 percent of what the Civil Rights movement was, or 10 percent of BLM protests in 2020, would be an overstatement.Simply put, if you have the time to be able to focus on what's going on with Israel to feeling it at such a personal level, you probably are living a life of privilege or upper middle class. People with those types of upbringing have the luxury of thinking about Israel like thinking about climate change or artificial intelligence. Which when you grow up with that type of educational upbringing and circle, it means your circle is usually Democrat. And if it's in the NYC, DC, LA, Chicago, Philly or Boston areas, it's even more Democrat than that.Show us your data though. Antisemitism has gradually been on the rise for years now. The uptick in nunbers started during Trump's term actually, if you look at hate crime indexes via FBI publicly published data. Yet all of that made no meaningful impact in a chance in voting amongst Jewish Americans.You can screen shot all of this. We can talk it over in late November or Decenber. You won't have an explanation. You'll probably say Jewish voters voted the same again because of abortion rights or what ever you can come up with deflect from not accepting responsibility over a prediction based on no data.Do you have multiple polls specific to Jewish Americans, including in the NYC area, to support your claim? Or are we to take your word for it based on the 11 people you are referring to who think like you because birds of a feather flock together?",

And you and I both know people will place more stock in the RCP average, 538 average, HQ average, what gambling markets are generally saying, and what analysts on all networks, red or blue leaning, are saying.My question is, if Lichtman in early August predicts a Biden victory, which seems to be the direction he is going unless a lot changes, will people accept that? How much you want to bet Trump supporters loved bragging on his prediction in summer 2016 and called it nonsense in 2020? All four keys open for debate out of 13 that would need to shift to Trump are highly unlikely to shift to Trump. For the purposes of gambling unrelated to biased partisanship opinions, I don't see Lichtman's prediction moving the market more than a couple cents either way. Yet, I do expect his analysis to be very useful.",

The funniest thing is that pause when Trump supporters go silent after he says something ridiculously stupid to see how they should react.You remember during the peak of the worse point of the pandemic when he would spend way too long on TV made it all  about him like usual, when he said should we consider injecting disinfectants in the body? Or opening up your chest for UV rays? He said it completely serious. No one laughed or thought he was joking. He waited a day to say he was joking. While conservatives were all over the place during that day scrambling to say he just doesn't understand how medicine works but he meant something else.The guy is an idiot that literally could have more money today from his inheritance if he sat on it and just profited on interest. He has gone bankrupt at least 4 times, paid no taxes in multiple years, and sadly can't even get his wife's name right. Mercedes, come on? But at a completely odd and unusual point randomly picks out a woman's name of someone of a husband who was relatively low on the political food chain who he probably never met before?The GOP used to be a party of thinking and ideas. It has become a party pandering to a buffoon. There are those who are doing the thinking being outnumbered by low information cultists.",

Conservatives used to be pull yourselves up by your boot straps keep the ball moving fight harder quietly if you move types. Now, they are some of the biggest crying, whining malcontents.They say wow so much winning going on when they are up, and when they lose say they are the biggest victims. What happened?

A perfect example being John Adam (2nd US president) who was quoted saying:\"Proofs that democracy is more pernicious than monarchy or aristocracy. Always has been, that absolute power intoxicates alike despots, monarchs, aristocrats, and democrats, and jacobins, and sans culottes.  The history of all ages shows that the caprice, cruelties, and horrors of democracy have soon disgusted, alarmed, and terrified themselves. They soon cry, “this will not do; we have gone too far! We are all in the wrong! We are none of us safe! We must unite in some clever fellow, who can protect us all,—Cæsar, Bonaparte, who you will! Though we distrust, hate, and abhor them all; yet we must submit to one or another of them, stand by him, cry him up to the skies, and swear that he is the greatest, best, and finest man that ever lived!”It has been my fortune, good or bad, to live in Europe ten years, from 1778 to 1788, in a public character. This destiny, singular in America, forced upon my attention the course of events in France, Holland, Geneva, and Switzerland, among many other nations; and this has irresistibly attracted my thoughts more than has been for my interest. The subject cannot have escaped you. What has been the conduct of the democratic parties in all those nations? How horribly bloody in some! Has it been steady, consistent, uniform, in any? Has it not leaped from democracy to aristocracy, to oligarchy, to military despotism, and back again to monarchy, as often, and as easily, as the birds fly to the lower, the middle, or the upper limbs of a tree, or leap from branch to branch, or hop from spray to spray?Democracy, nevertheless, must not be disgraced; democracy must not be despised. Democracy must be respected; democracy must be honored; democracy must be cherished; democracy must be an essential, an integral part of the sovereignty, and have a control over the whole government, or moral liberty cannot exist, or any other liberty. I have been always grieved by the gross abuses of this respectable word. Yet some still speak of it as the most amiable, venerable, indeed, as the sole object of its adoration; the other, as the sole object of its scorn, abhorrence, and execration.  in so doing know not what they say. Some of them care not what they say, provided they can accomplish their own selfish purposes. These ought not to be forgiven.\"We are not nor will ever be a democracy and yes it is hated as it should be",

Either that, or Biden is a medical marvel who's somehow able to experience Alzheimer's/Parkinson's/other diseases that cause dementia much more slowly than other humans.Both cases mean you don't really have much to worry about, other than the fact that Biden is old, but if you factor in Trump's obesity, Biden probably will end up living longer.Don't forget, if Trump wins, he will be the oldest president EVER elected.",

I see the pro Trump people posting insults, misinformation, lies, ridicule and even vitriol, not only on this site but social media in general. If any of these sites try to stop, curb or censor any of the pro Trump people, they will get triggered and try to raise hell. On the other hand, if anti Trump posts ruffle any feathers whatsoever, they get immediately censored and no one bats an eye. The anti group has to be careful to be proper, polite, and guard their opponents' feelings for some reason. In this very thread I tried to post a comment listing the factual issues with Trump thus far and it immediately got rejected. In a battle of two groups where the first has card blanche to say and do whatever they want, and the second has to mind their P's and Q's, obviously the first group has an unfair advantage. I'm wondering why it is this way.",

        "opContent": "Howdy! To all my Democratic friends:Regardless of what the courts say, ultimately, it will be up to us - the voters - to kick him (you know who) to the curb in November. Don't think that this verdict will deter him from running for president, nor will it deter the GOP from backing him. The only way to stop them is to vote President Joe Biden back into office while electing as many Democrats as possible to Congress, and for that WE must step up.So, rather than worry about what he (you know who) will say next, or how his most fanatical MAGA followers will react, put your angst into action:1. Donate to Joe Biden and other Democrats!2. Volunteer to get involved with a local campaign and/or Democratic organization.3. Talk with your friends & family, and get them to understand the importance of this election. Make plans to vote.4. Register people to vote.5. Write letters to the editor of your local paper.6. Join a phone bank.7. Sign up to write postcards to voters in swing states (my favorite for this is Postcards to Swing States - https://www.turnoutpac.org/... )8. Take time to relax while you fight the good fight; it's a marathon, not a sprint. You won't do anyone any good if you burn out.9. Share important messages like this to social media (hint: pass it along!)Remember, WE must be the ones to re-elect Joe Biden to the U.S. presidency. WE must take charge and protect democracy. WE must be responsible for upholding the rule of law & our Constitution. Complacency is the enemy, and we cannot expect anyone else to do it for us, because our fate is in our own hands.So let's get to work!🙂 #JoeBiden #Biden #BidenHarris #Biden2024 #BidenHarris2024 #vote #Vote2024 #VoteBlue #Democrats",

And, importantly, he did prosecute Michael Cohen so they made a very conscious choice NOT to prosecute Trump. Won't stop these irrational people from bitching up a storm, though, and coming up with inane conspiracy theories because that's what they do. If they want to complain about Manhattan DAs then fine but for the love of God don't blame Biden. This is literally the last case Biden wanted prosecuted because it is the weakest and hurts him politically.",

Let's assume that they randomly selected 18 Manhattanites, and all 18 had to serve on the jury. The chance of any one of those jurors having voted for Trump in 2020 is 12%. So the odds that there was AT LEAST one conservative juror is 1-(0.88^12) which is 78%.But what if that juror is just an alternative, oh which there were 6? Ok, so what are the odds that 7 of the 18 jurors were conservative? The math is more complicated, but the odds of that happening are 0.28%. Seems rigged, right?Except Trump's team had a say in who was and wasn't chose on for the jury. I can't find the exact number, but there were at least 200 people considered for the jury. Since the initial selection was random, statistically speaking there were at least 24 Trump voters in the pool. If Trump's team was even moderatly successful and were able to throw out enough jurors to get the ideological composition to change from 12% Trump voter to 24% voter, the odds of a Trump juror increase astronomically:Chance of 1 of the 12 being a Trump voter: 1-(0.76^12)= 96%Chance of 7 of the 18 jurors being Trump voters: 7.13%Any good lawyer could probably get that up to a 60/40 D/R ideological split, in which case, the odds are 99.7% and 18.9%, respectivelyTrump supporters can whine all the want, but the odds are that there was at least one Trump voters (or at least conservative voter) on the jury.",

        "opContent": "November 5th, 2024 - Election Night7:00pm EST - The first polls close in parts of Indiana and Kentucky. Exit polls show Trump with a commanding lead in both states, which is expected in these deep red strongholds. However, the margins are even larger than anticipated, with Trump leading by over 30 points in each. This sets an ominous tone for the Biden campaign.7:30pm - More polls close in North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia. Again, Trump substantially outperforms his 2020 numbers. He leads by double digits in all three states, even flipping the swing state of North Carolina back into the red column decisively. Cheers erupt at Trump headquarters while the mood at Biden's camp grows tense.8:00pm - A big wave of poll closings across the East Coast and Midwest: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C. Shockingly, Trump has pulled ahead in all of these states, even traditionally blue bastions in the Northeast. He holds a 5 point lead in New York, a 10 point advantage in New Jersey, and is running even with Biden in deep-blue Massachusetts and Maryland. A red wave is cresting.In Florida, a state Trump won narrowly in 2016 and 2020, he's ahead by a whopping 20 points. The Latino vote has swung massively in his favor. Even more stunning, Trump is winning the African American vote in many states, overperforming with this demographic by 30-40 points compared to 2020. It's an unprecedented shift.9:00pm - Polls close in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Trump tsunami shows no signs of abating. He's now leading in every state that's been called so far, and in the states too close to call.Wisconsin and Michigan, two critical swing states that narrowly went to Biden in 2020, are firmly in Trump's column this time. He's ahead by over 15 points in both. Minnesota, a state that's been blue since 1972, has also flipped to Trump. The upper Midwest is now a sea of red.Perhaps most stunningly, Trump holds a 10 point lead in New York and a 5 point edge in California. The entire West Coast is competitive. Audible gasps and a sense of disbelief are heard at Biden election night headquarters. The impossible seems to be happening.10:00pm - Polls close in Iowa, Montana, Nevada, and Utah. All are immediately called for Trump. He's now been declared the winner in 30 states and leads in all the rest. Biden has not been able to claim a single state. It's a wipeout of historic proportions.11:00pm - California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho polls close. Shockingly, Trump is quickly declared the winner in California, Oregon, and Washington - states that haven't gone Republican since the 1980s. He's winning by double digit margins up and down the West Coast. Idaho is also called for Trump as expected.12:00am - Polls close in Hawaii and Alaska. They too are immediately projected for Trump. He's now won all 50 states - the first clean sweep since George Washington in 1789 and 1792. The popular vote margin is enormous. Trump has won over 70% of the popular vote, the largest landslide in American history, surpassing FDR's 60.8% in 1936.At Trump headquarters, wild celebrations erupt. A huge throng of supporters chant \"USA! USA!\" and \"Four More Years!\" as Trump takes the stage to declare victory. In a gracious speech, he promises to be a president for all Americans and to heal the divisions in the country. He compliments Joe Biden on a hard fought race.On the other side, the mood at Biden HQ is funereal. Staffers weep and console each other. When Biden finally emerges to give his concession speech, he is gracious but shell-shocked. He congratulates Trump on his historic victory and urges the country to come together. But he seems dazed, struggling to comprehend the scale of his defeat.In the coming days, political pundits will pick apart the results of the 2024 election. Many credit Trump's stunning sweep to the roaring economic recovery that followed his 2016 victory. Others point to the chaotic Biden presidency from 2021-2024, which was plagued by inflation, crime, and foreign policy blunders. The successful Trump brokered Middle East peace deals and the landmark trade agreement with China also boosted his popularity. And the collapse of the Democratic party into the far left socialist wing drove many moderates to Trump.Regardless of the reasons, the result is clear - a resounding, 50 state mandate for Trump's America First agenda. He will enter his second term with more political capital than any president in modern American history. The 2024 election will be remembered as the night Trumpism triumphed over traditional politics in a landslide of unprecedented proportions. American elections will never be the same.",

How will the Democrats take the Whitehouse?My guess:1 Barack Obama will run for vice president along with Joe Biden for President2 Taylor Swift will endorse this ticket.3 Kamala Harris will be appointed to the Supreme Court ( or some other lofty position).Reasons:#1 is constitutional since the only prohibition is against running for President is  two times. There is no such prohibition for vice president. From there,  a number of things could happen(Joe is judged incompetent, Joe resigns or dies) where Obama becomes President.#2. Taylor Swift is more influential now than Oprah when Obama ran in 2008. Oprah endorsed Obama in 2008. It was a major influence in his election.#3. Kamala will be eased out so as not to create problem with certain voters.Where am I wrong?",

This is why MAGA is angry.  Cause little girls and people of color with degrees out work/earn/learn them and make them look like the lazy entitled losers they really are.Also why it benefits them to keep women barefoot and pregnant.  Their boys can't compete 'cause they are slow and stoopud MAGA spawn like Haywood's son.",

The Dems have been kicking the crap out of the GOP in every election cycle since Dobbs, and it's almost exclusively due to this one issue because it is motivating the hell out of women to vote. I was meeting just yesterday with a Democratic candidate who is running for our local county board, and she's talking about abortion access because she knows it will play well with independent and moderate Republican women. Yet ol' Crooked Don and his MAGA-kiddos somehow think this issue won't cause them any trouble come November. Nothing will give me more pleasure than watching a bunch of pissed-off women send him packing :)",

Right now, the keys suggest that if the economy doesn’t go into recession, Biden will be re-elected.",

I don’t think Biden grasps what 81% opposition to his Gaza war means. Young people thinking they have come to stop genocide will prove far more potent than the establishment of dems think. They take comfort that Gaza is not high on list of things the young worry about. But concern for housing does not motivate anyone to fight, get injured or die. To fight against genocide does and once the flames of the battle is lit, mundane worries disappear. The 54/45 that has been running is absurd. It should be a toss up at best for Biden. ( 81% overall means inside major cities opposition is nearly total. The youth are explosive and they back the “frontlines”. All is needed a match. A serious injury, a shooting… and fire will ignite like of which we have not seen in a    long time, they are coming to Chicago, permits or not they are coming. )",

Shared values are not shared values when your side starves babies. I draw the line there with you. Genocide might or might not be, but it is certainly a massive crime against humanity. To those youngsters it is and we are about to see fire and rage we have not seen in a long time. I have not agreed with much of what they have stood up in past but they gained my respect. They are off their basements and phones and out to do battle for a moral cause.",

In a close election, it doesn't take much to flip the outcome of the race and many people believe that Biden will overtake Trump for a variety of reasons. Some example reasons are:Incumbents tend to poll lower at this point in the raceThe poor performance of Trump endorsed candidates in the 2022 midterms means that Trump will under perform in the 2024 presidential election.Democrats have the larger base but with more soft support in their coalition. This means that there are a lot of eventual Biden voters who are not answering that they will vote for Biden at this point in the race.This is the first presidential election after Roe v. Wade was overturned and Democrats will see an under reported demographic show up to vote.I'm not saying these reasons are necessarily accurate, I just suspect that is what's going through bettor's heads. Time will tell to see if the polls do shift or the current margins maintain.",

I hate to use the term \"Occams Razor\" since its been grossly abused since that silly movie \"Contact\" came out, but whats more likely: 1) There was a random water main leak that just happened to pop on election night 2020 and caused the vote counting center in Atlanta to shut down for a day, and Biden genuinely won GA by a few thousand legitimate votes. 2) The leak was either baloney, or sabotage to allow some shenanigans to go on and allow a couple thousand ballots to be snuck in the back door the middle of the night? Think of the cameras in Jeffrey Epteins cell before you answer.",

The headline says it all. Man, you can't help fools :)Republicans pushing to embrace mail-in voting encounter widespread resistancehttps://www.yahoo.com/news/...\"When Donald Trump held a rally last year in Erie County, an important area in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the top Republican official there went one by one to the 11,000 people waiting in line to ask one question: Would you like to vote by mail?It did not go well.“I tried to give them a mail-in ballot application, and could only get out about 300,” Tom Eddy, head of the county’s Republican Party, said. “Every one of them said either, ‘No, that’s not the right way to vote,’ or ‘Trump does not agree with it.’”What happened in Erie County is emblematic of the ongoing feud within the GOP over one of the most fundamental elements of elections: how to vote. And it reflects a strain at a critical time for the party, when national and battleground polling has shown the 2024 presidential election could be won at the margins.\"",

The top 3 issues in which Biden polls underwater are economy/inflation, border enforcement, and foreign policy.Address them by November and Biden’s reelection odds jump from a coin toss to almost certain. Negotiate peace deals for Israel & Ukraine, the U.S. has a lot of leverage as the main weapons supplier. Take some executive actions on the border. Inflation is the toughest nut to crack but there’s help from the Federal Reserve.But nope, “ORANGE MAN BAD.”",

The difference in GDP growth is even larger: 4.23% under Democrats, versus just 2.36% under Republicans. If one goes back to the Great Depression, adding the administrations of Republican Herbert Hoover and Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt to the mix, the difference in growth rates is even larger.  Democratic Presidents deliver a better economy than Republican Presidents.",

Once again, the bottom line is this: polls are not what matters; what matters is actual election results. And as far as actual results, the Democrats are kicking the crap out of the Republicans. In addition, as the second article outlines, Biden & the DNC are way ahead of Trump & the RNC in terms of organizing in battleground states, especially with the RNC purging staffers all over the place (presumably because they aren't \"loyal enough\" to Trump). But let all the MAGA-kiddos here talk trash, because it's all they've got. While they talk trash, we'll be organizing our ground game & winning elections :)Republicans Have an Internal Polling Problemhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/n...Trump slow to invest in states that could decide election as some in GOP fear 'skeleton' campaignhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/...",

Biden did a bit more. Pinning it all on one decision is disingenuous. Given that much of the world has higher inflation than the U.S., it seems we've done an exceptional job at bringing it down.https://www.imf.org/externa...Inflation by itself is also not the entire picture. Wages are up since 2021 (when Biden took office). If the wages line stays above the inflation line in 2024, people will be able to buy more in 2024 than they could at the end of 2020. You can look up \"real wage growth\" if you want to do more research. \n\n\nView\n\n\n Hide\n\n\n\n\n https://www.statista.com/st...",

There are no \"supply chain issues\" with rent, groceries, utilities or used car prices etc. Many countries did better than us on inflation. And since the US dollar is the worlds reserve currency and most commodities are priced and traded in US dollars on international markets, then yeah,  adding $8 trillion to the amount of US dollars already in circulation is going to affect everybody. Trump only wanted $1.5 trillion in unemployment relief and direct checks to Americans. Pelosi and the Democrat controlled House tacked on $2.5 trillion in pork to the \"Covid relief\" bills, then rammed through another $4 trillion in 2021 and 2022 with Biden.",
